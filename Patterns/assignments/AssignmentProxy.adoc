= Home Assignment: Implementing the Proxy Pattern in Java with Real-life Example

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Proxy design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of providing a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

== Instructions

1. Imagine you are the owner of a high-end art gallery that displays valuable artworks.
2. Create a Java project named "ArtGallery" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
3. Implement the Proxy design pattern with the following components:

=== Artwork
An interface representing an artwork, with methods for viewing and purchasing the artwork.

=== RealArtwork
A concrete class representing a real artwork in the gallery. It implements the Artwork interface and contains the actual implementation of viewing and purchasing the artwork.

=== ArtworkProxy
A proxy class that acts as a placeholder for the real artwork. It implements the Artwork interface and controls access to the real artwork by adding extra functionality such as access control or logging.

4. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
5. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
6. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
7. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
8. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
9. Implement the Proxy pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- As the owner of the art gallery, you want to protect your valuable artworks from unauthorized access and track viewing and purchasing activities.
- Implement an Artwork interface with methods for viewing and purchasing the artwork.
- Create a RealArtwork class representing a real artwork in the gallery, with actual implementations of viewing and purchasing methods.
- Implement an ArtworkProxy class that acts as a proxy for the real artwork, controlling access to it by adding extra functionality such as access control and logging.

10. Test your implementation by creating instances of ArtworkProxy and accessing real artworks through the proxy.
11. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
12. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
13. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing an ArtGallery using the Proxy pattern in Java with a real-life example!
