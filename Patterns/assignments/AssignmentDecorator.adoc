= Home Assignment: Implementing the Decorator Pattern in Java with Real-life Example

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Decorator design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of attaching additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

== Instructions

1. Imagine you are a bakery owner who specializes in making custom cakes for special occasions.
2. Create a Java project named "CustomCakes" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
3. Implement the Decorator design pattern with the following components:

=== Cake
An interface representing a basic cake, with methods for describing and pricing the cake.

=== BasicCake
A concrete class implementing the Cake interface, representing a simple, basic cake.

=== CakeDecorator
An abstract decorator class that extends the Cake interface and acts as a base class for concrete decorators. It contains a reference to a Cake object.

=== FlavorDecorator, ToppingDecorator
Concrete decorator classes representing different cake decorations such as flavors and toppings. They extend the CakeDecorator class and add additional functionality to the cake.

4. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
5. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
6. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
7. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
8. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
9. Implement the Decorator pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- As a bakery owner, you want to offer custom cakes with various flavors and toppings to your customers.
- Implement a Cake interface with methods for describing and pricing the cake.
- Create a BasicCake class representing a simple, basic cake.
- Implement a CakeDecorator abstract class that extends the Cake interface and contains a reference to a Cake object.
- Create FlavorDecorator and ToppingDecorator classes representing different cake decorations such as flavors and toppings. They extend the CakeDecorator class and add additional functionality to the cake.
- Use the Decorator pattern to dynamically add flavors and toppings to custom cakes while preserving the ability to mix and match decorations.

10. Test your implementation by creating instances of BasicCake and decorating them with different flavors and toppings using decorator objects.
11. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
12. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
13. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing CustomCakes using the Decorator pattern in Java with a real-life example!
