= Home Assignment: Implementing the Strategy Pattern in Java with Real-life Example

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Strategy design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable.

== Instructions

1. Imagine you are a delivery service provider that offers different shipping options to customers.
2. Create a Java project named "ShippingService" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
3. Implement the Strategy design pattern with the following components:

=== ShippingStrategy
An interface representing a shipping strategy, with a method for calculating the shipping cost.

=== StandardShipping, ExpressShipping, SameDayShipping
Concrete classes implementing the ShippingStrategy interface, representing different shipping options with their own algorithms for calculating shipping costs.

=== ShippingContext
A context class that contains a reference to a ShippingStrategy and allows clients to change the shipping strategy dynamically.

4. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
5. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
6. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
7. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
8. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
9. Implement the Strategy pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- As a delivery service provider, you want to offer customers different shipping options with varying costs.
- Implement a ShippingStrategy interface with a method for calculating the shipping cost.
- Create StandardShipping, ExpressShipping, and SameDayShipping classes representing different shipping options with their own algorithms for calculating shipping costs.
- Implement a ShippingContext class that contains a reference to a ShippingStrategy and allows clients to change the shipping strategy dynamically.
- Use the Strategy pattern to encapsulate each shipping algorithm and make them interchangeable, allowing customers to choose different shipping options at checkout.

10. Test your implementation by creating instances of ShippingContext with different shipping strategies and calculating shipping costs for various orders.
11. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
12. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
13. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing ShippingService using the Strategy pattern in Java with a real-life example!
