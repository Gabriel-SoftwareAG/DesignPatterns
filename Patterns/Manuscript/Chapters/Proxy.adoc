= The Proxy Pattern

== Introduction
Imagine you have a legal question or need to handle a legal matter, but you're not familiar with the laws or how to proceed. Instead of trying to figure it out yourself, you hire a lawyer. This lawyer acts as your representative, using their knowledge and expertise to advise you, speak on your behalf, and navigate the legal system for you. Essentially, the lawyer is a go-between for you and the legal world, making sure your needs are met without you having to dive into the complexities of law yourself. image:../images/proxy_lawyer.jpg[]

The Proxy Pattern in software development is quite similar to hiring a lawyer. In this pattern, a proxy object acts as an intermediary between the client (you) and another system or resource (the legal system, in our analogy). Just as a lawyer translates your needs into legal actions, manages the process, and communicates results back to you, a proxy object in software takes requests from its client, does the necessary work to interact with the underlying system or resource, and then returns the results. This setup helps manage complexity, control access, and even optimize performance, all without the client needing to know the intricacies of the system they're interacting with.
