= The Composite Pattern

== Introduction
Imagine you're putting together a music playlist for a party. You start by selecting individual songs, each a single piece of music that stands alone. As you organize your playlist, you also decide to include entire albums or collections of songs by specific artists. Now, your playlist is a mix of individual songs (simple objects) and whole albums (composite objects). When you play the playlist at the party, it doesn't matter whether a track is from an album or a single release; each piece of music contributes to the party atmosphere. Furthermore, if you wanted, you could group several albums and songs into a themed collection, like "80s Hits" or "Summer Vibes," which then also becomes part of the playlist. This way, your playlist can handle both individual songs and collections of songs, with the flexibility to include larger collections that are composites of composites, all contributing to the overall experience seamlessly. image:../images/composite_music.jpg[]

In software, the Composite Pattern allows similar flexibility. It lets you treat individual objects and compositions of objects (composites) uniformly. Just like with the playlist, where both individual songs and entire albums are part of the lineup, in software, simple objects and composite objects can be treated the same way. This pattern enables a tree structure, where leaves (individual objects) and nodes (composites) can contain other nodes. It simplifies working with complex structures, allowing you to apply operations over both individual elements and groups of elements, including groups that contain other groups, much like playing a single song or an entire album from your party playlist.
