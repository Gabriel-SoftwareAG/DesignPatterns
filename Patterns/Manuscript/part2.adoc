Structural patterns are the framework that underpins your software architecture, analogous to the structure of a towering skyscraper. They organize different components of a system to ensure cohesive operation.

In this section of the book, we will examine various structural patterns, each offering unique advantages:

- _The Adapter pattern_ is like using a travel adapter overseas. It enables devices with different plug shapes to connect seamlessly with foreign outlets, ensuring your electronic devices function without complications.
- _The Composite pattern_ is similar to building a music playlist for a party. You group various songs into a playlist, treating the collection as a single entity which simplifies organization and playback.
- _The Proxy pattern_ is comparable to hiring a lawyer. You engage with the lawyer who represents you in legal matters, handling complex interactions on your behalf, thus streamlining your legal engagements.
- _The Flyweight pattern_ is like decorating a large party hall with hundreds of balloons. Instead of individual decorations for each event, you reuse and configure these balloons to suit various themes, reducing the need for numerous unique decorations.
- _The Bridge pattern_ is comparable to using a universal remote control. It separates a deviceâ€™s interface from its implementation, allowing you to control multiple devices independently, thereby simplifying management without intertwining their operations.
- _The Facade pattern_ resembles a car with advanced features. It presents a simple interface to access a range of complex functionalities, hiding the sophisticated mechanics from the driver.
- _The Decorator pattern_ is akin to customizing a pizza. Starting with a basic pizza, you add toppings incrementally without altering the underlying dough, enhancing its flavor with each addition.


Let's explore these structural design patterns and uncover how they can bolster your ability to design robust and scalable software systems!
