== Introduction
[cols="2", frame="none", grid="none"]
|===
|Imagine you have a favorite toy, let's say it's a teddy bear. Over time, this teddy bear might get worn out or damaged because you play with it a lot. But what if you could easily make an exact copy of your favorite teddy bear whenever you need a new one?

That's where the prototype pattern comes in. It's like having a special machine that can duplicate your favorite teddy bear perfectly. You don't need to go through the hassle of designing and sewing a new teddy bear from scratch every time. Instead, you just use the prototype – your original teddy bear – to create as many copies as you want.

|===

So, in simpler terms, the prototype pattern allows you to create new objects by copying an existing object. It's like making a photocopy of your favorite toy whenever you need a replacement. This saves time and effort because you don't have to start from scratch every time you want to create a similar object.

== Key Components
- _Prototype_: In this analogy, the original teddy bear acts as the prototype. It represents the object that serves as a template for creating new copies.
- _Cloneable Interface_: Similar to the special machine in the analogy, the Cloneable interface allows objects to specify that they support cloning, enabling the creation of exact copies.
- _Concrete Prototype_: These are the actual objects that implement the Cloneable interface and define how cloning is performed. In the analogy, these would be the teddy bears created by copying the original prototype.
- _Client_: The entity that requests the creation of new objects using the prototype. In the analogy, the client corresponds to the user who wants to create copies of their favorite teddy bear without going through the hassle of designing and sewing each one from scratch.

== UML Diagrams 
Next, we will explain the concept of the Prototype design pattern using UML.


[discrete%breakable]
=== Class Diagram
image::PrototypePatternClassDiagram.png[title="The Prototype Class Diagram", align=center]
In  the class diagram, the abstract class `Prototype` serves as the blueprint for creating new teddy bears, declaring the `clone()` method that enables the creation of exact copies. The `ConcretePrototype1` and `ConcretePrototype2` classes represent specific types of teddy bears that implement the cloning mechanism defined by the `Prototype` class. Each concrete `prototype` class provides its own implementation of the `clone()` method, allowing for customization and variation in the cloning process. Through this pattern, users can create multiple copies of their favorite teddy bear without needing to recreate it from scratch, just like making duplicates of a beloved toy.


[discrete%breakable]
=== Sequence Diagram
image::PrototypePatternSequenceDiagram.png[title="The Prototype Sequence Diagram", align=center]
In the sequence diagram, the Client interacts with the `Prototype`, which acts as the template for creating new teddy bears. When the Client requests a clone using the `clone()` method, the `Prototype` activates and delegates the cloning process to the `ConcretePrototype`, representing a specific type of teddy bear. The `ConcretePrototype` creates a copy of itself using the `clone()` method, which is then returned to the `Prototype`. Finally, the `Prototype` passes the cloned teddy bear back to the Client, who receives an exact duplicate of their favorite toy. 


== Implementation Walkthrough

=== Abstract Prototype Class: Prototype
[source, {lang}]
----
ifeval::["{lang}" == "java"]
include::{java_path}/prototype/Prototype.java[lines=3..]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{lang}" == "python"]
include::{python_path}/prototype/Prototype.py[lines=3..]

include::{csharp_path}/prototype/Prototype.cs[lines=3..]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{lang}" == "typescript"]
include::{typescript_path}/prototype/Prototype.ts[lines=3..]
endif::[]
----

The `Prototype` abstract class declares the `clone()` method, which will be implemented by concrete subclasses to enable cloning. In the teddy bear analogy, this class represents the blueprint for creating new teddy bears.

=== Concrete Prototype Classes: WhiteTeddyBearPrototype and BlackTeddyBearPrototype

ifeval::["{lang}" == "java"]

ifeval::["{lang}" == "python"]

endif::[]

ifeval::["{lang}" == "typescript"]
include::{typescript_path}/prototype/BlackTeddyBearPrototype.ts[lines=3..]
endif::[]
----

The `WhiteTeddyBearPrototype` and `BlackTeddyBearPrototype` classes extend the `Prototype` class and provide specific implementations of the `clone()` method. In the teddy bear analogy, these classes represent different types of teddy bears that can be duplicated.


[discrete%breakable]
=== Usage Example
[source, {lang}]
----
ifeval::["{lang}" == "java"]
include::{java_path}/prototype/Client.java[lines=3..]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{lang}" == "python"]
include::{python_path}/prototype/Client.py[lines=3..]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{lang}" == "csharp"]
include::{csharp_path}/prototype/Client.cs[lines=3..]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{lang}" == "typescript"]
include::{typescript_path}/prototype/Client.ts[lines=3..]
endif::[]
----

In the usage example, the user creates instances of concrete prototypes (`BlackTeddyBearPrototype` and `WhiteTeddyBearPrototype`) and clones them using the `clone()` method. Finally, it displays information about the cloned teddy bears.

=== Code Output
The above code output is:

Cloning White Teddy Bear
Cloning Black Teddy Bear
Cloned Teddy Bear 1: WhiteTeddyBearPrototype
Cloned Teddy Bear 2: BlackTeddyBearPrototype

== Design Considerations
When implementing the Prototype Pattern for object cloning, several design considerations should be taken into account:

* **Cloning Mechanism**: Careful consideration should be given to how cloning is performed to ensure that the copied objects are exact replicas of the original. This includes deep copying complex objects (as opposed to shallow copying) to avoid unintended sharing of mutable state between the original and cloned objects.

* **Interface Design**: The Prototype interface or abstract class should provide a clear contract for implementing classes to follow. This includes defining the `clone()` method signature and any other necessary methods or properties for cloning.

* **Handling State**: Consideration should be given to how the state of cloned objects is handled. Immutable state is preferable to avoid unintended modifications, or if mutable state is necessary, proper initialization or copying mechanisms should be employed to ensure consistency.

* **Performance**: Depending on the complexity of the objects being cloned and the frequency of cloning operations, performance considerations such as memory usage and processing time should be taken into account. Efforts should be made to optimize the cloning process while maintaining accuracy and reliability.

== Conclusion
The Prototype Pattern provides a powerful mechanism for object cloning, allowing for the creation of new objects by copying existing ones. By using a prototype as a template, the pattern enables the creation of exact replicas without the need to know the specific details of how the objects are constructed. By considering design considerations such as cloning mechanism, interface design, state handling and performance, developers can leverage the Prototype Pattern to efficiently manage object creation and cloning in their software projects.
