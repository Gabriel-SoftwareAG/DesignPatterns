== Introduction

|===
|Imagine you're traveling to a foreign country where you don't speak the language. To communicate with locals, you hire an interpreter who translates your words into the local language and vice versa.

In software design, the interpreter pattern works similarly. It's used to interpret or evaluate expressions written in a specific language. Just like a human interpreter translates between languages, a software interpreter translates between different languages or formats within a computer program.

For example, let's say you're building a calculator application that can evaluate mathematical expressions. You can implement an interpreter that understands mathematical expressions written in a specific format, such as infix notation (e.g., "2 + 3 * 5").

The interpreter parses these expressions, evaluates them according to mathematical rules, and returns the result.

Similarly, interpreters can be used in other domains, such as parsing and evaluating programming languages, querying databases, or processing markup languages like XML or JSON. In each case, the interpreter pattern provides a way to interpret expressions or commands written in a specific format and perform the necessary actions based on that interpretation.

Overall, the interpreter pattern enables the processing of expressions or commands written in a specific language or format within a computer program, similar to how a human interpreter translates between languages to facilitate communication between people.

== Key Components

- _AbstractExpression (Interface)_: This component represents the expression interface that declares an interpret operation. Just like a human interpreter who understands and translates languages, the AbstractExpression in the interpreter pattern provides the foundation for interpreting various expressions in a specific language or format. Each concrete expression in the program must implement this interface.

- _TerminalExpression (Class)_: A class that implements the AbstractExpression interface for interpreting terminal expressions in the language. In the analogy, this would be akin to interpreting basic words or phrases that don't need further decomposition. For a calculator application, TerminalExpression might interpret individual numbers or simple operands.

- _NonTerminalExpression (Class)_: This class also implements the AbstractExpression interface but is used for interpreting expressions that are composed of multiple expressions. Similar to complex sentences that require contextual understanding in language translation, NonTerminalExpression handles the logic for combining or processing multiple TerminalExpressions or NonTerminalExpressions according to the rules of the language or format.

- _Context (Class)_: Represents the context of the interpretation, containing information that's global to the interpreter. In our travel analogy, this could be akin to the specific details or rules of grammar and syntax of the local language that the interpreter must understand. In software, Context might include the specifics of the expression format or the environment in which the expression should be evaluated.

- _Client (Class)_: The client utilizes the interpreter. It constructs the necessary expressions and calls the interpret method to evaluate or process the expression. Just like a traveler who forms sentences to communicate a message and relies on the interpreter to translate, the Client in the pattern constructs expressions using the language or format understood by the interpreter to achieve a specific outcome, such as calculating the result of a mathematical expression.
