== Introduction
[cols="2", frame="none", grid="none"]
|===
|The flyweight design pattern is similar to sharing books in a library. It involves maximizing resource utilization through sharing. Just as a library allows multiple readers to share a single copy of a book instead of each person needing a personal copy, the flyweight pattern enables sharing of common state objects to minimize memory usage in software applications. This pattern is particularly useful when a large number of objects with identical or similar state information are required (like the books in the library). It works by separating the intrinsic state (the unchanging part) of the object, which is shared, from the extrinsic state (the changing part), which is kept external. By doing so, the flyweight design pattern allows for a reduction in the number of instantiated objects, thus optimizing both memory and processing resources in software systems.

== Key Components

*Flyweight*: Represents the shared books in a library, such as popular titles in genres like mystery, romance, science, and history. These are common and reusable resources in the library, similar to the intrinsic state in flyweights that is shared among multiple borrowers.

*Concrete Flyweight*: Acts as the specific copy of a book in the shared collection, capable of accepting unique settings like current borrower or due date. These reflect the flyweight's capability to handle external states passed in by the borrower.

*Flyweight Factory*: Manages the cataloging and distribution of library books. It ensures that each book is cataloged only once and reused wherever needed, similar to a system that checks if a specific book is already available before acquiring another copy.

*Client*: The library patron who borrows the books. The client decides what books to borrow and for how long, specifying any unique attributes (extrinsic state) such as due dates or special handling requests.

*Extrinsic State*: Involves the specific details associated with each borrowing of the book, such as the borrower's ID and the due date. This state is managed by the borrower and differs with each use of the book, unlike the shared book itself.

== UML Diagrams 
Next, we will explain the concept of the Flyweight design pattern using UML.

=== Class Diagram
image::FlyweightPatternClassDiagram.png[title="The Flyweight Class Diagram", align=center]
In this class diagram, the Flyweight interface represents a type of book, defining the operation to perform. The ConcreteFlyweight class represents a specific genre of book, like mystery or romance, storing intrinsic state (such as title or author) that is shareable across many copies. The FlyweightFactory class acts as a library book management system, managing different genres of books and cataloging them as needed to ensure they are shared properly. Finally, the Client class represents a library patron, maintaining extrinsic state (unique for each book, like borrower ID or due date) and passing it to the book's checkout process. By using this pattern, you can achieve a comprehensive lending system with a variety of books while minimizing resource usage and improving efficiency by reusing common book genres.

=== Sequence Diagram
image::FlyweightPatternSequenceDiagram.png[title="The Flyweight Sequence Diagram", align=center]
In this sequence diagram, the Client represents a library patron, while the `FlyweightFactory` acts as a library management system that catalogs different types of books. When the client requests a book with specific intrinsic state (such as genre or author), the factory checks if a book with that intrinsic state already exists. If it does, the factory returns the existing book to the client. If not, the factory creates a new catalog entry for the book with the given intrinsic state and returns it to the client. The client then performs an operation on the book, potentially using both intrinsic and extrinsic state (unique to each book, like borrower ID or due date). This pattern allows for the efficient use of memory and resources by reusing existing books where possible and creating new catalog entries only when needed.

== Implementation Walkthrough
In this example, we demonstate the use of the Flyweight Pattern in a library book management system. The system is designed to efficiently manage and share library books among multiple patrons, minimizing memory usage and optimizing resource allocation.

= Library Book Management System: Flyweight Pattern with Return Functionality

== Overview
This document describes the implementation of the Flyweight Pattern with added functionality for returning books in a library book management system. This system is designed to manage books efficiently, allowing multiple patrons to borrow and return books, thus optimizing resource allocation and minimizing memory usage.

== Classes and Interfaces

=== Flyweight Interface (Book)
The `Book` interface is essential in our implementation. It outlines the necessary methods that all book types in the system must implement, focusing on operations related to checking out and returning books.

[source,java]
----
public interface Book {
    boolean isAvailable();
    void checkOut(String borrowerId, String dueDate);
    void returnBook();
}
----

=== ConcreteFlyweight Class (GenreBook)
The `GenreBook` class implements the `Book` interface and is responsible for a specific genre of books. It manages intrinsic state details like title, author, and genre and tracks the availability of the book.

[source,java]
----
public class GenreBook implements Book {
    private final String title;
    private final String author;
    private final String genre; // Intrinsic state
    private boolean isAvailable = true; // Availability status

    public GenreBook(String title, String author, String genre) {
        this.title = title;
        this.author = author;
        this.genre = genre;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean isAvailable() {
        return isAvailable;
    }

    @Override
    public void checkOut(String borrowerId, String dueDate) {
        if (isAvailable) {
            System.out.println("Book: " + title + " checked out by " + borrowerId + " due on " + dueDate);
            isAvailable = false;
        } else {
            System.out.println("Book: " + title + " is currently unavailable for checkout.");
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void returnBook() {
        isAvailable = true;
        System.out.println("Book: " + title + " has been returned and is now available.");
    }
}
----

=== FlyweightFactory Class (Library)
The `Library` class functions as the `FlyweightFactory`. It oversees the creation and distribution of `GenreBook` instances and ensures that books are created and reused appropriately, incorporating functionality to manage both borrowing and returning books.

[source,java]
----
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Library {
    private Map<String, Book> booksByGenre = new HashMap<>();

    public Book getBook(String genre, String title, String author) {
        String key = genre + "|" + title + "|" + author;
        if (!booksByGenre.containsKey(key)) {
            booksByGenre.put(key, new GenreBook(title, author, genre));
            System.out.println("A new copy of the book has been ordered: " + title);
        }
        return booksByGenre.get(key);
    }
}
----

=== Client Class (LibraryPatron)
The `LibraryPatron` class represents the client, handling interactions with the `Library` for checking out and returning books. This class manages extrinsic states such as the borrower's ID and due dates.

[source,java]
----
public class LibraryPatron {
    private String patronId;

    public LibraryPatron(String patronId) {
        this.patronId = patronId;
    }

    public void borrowBook(Library library, String genre, String title, String author, String dueDate) {
        Book book = library.getBook(genre, title, author);
        book.checkOut(patronId, dueDate);
    }

    public void returnBook(Library library, String genre, String title, String author) {
        Book book = library.getBook(genre, title, author);
        book.returnBook();
    }
}
----

== Example Usage

This example demonstrates a sequence where a library patron orders a book, another copy is ordered, one copy is returned, and then the returned copy is borrowed again:

[source,java]
----
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Library library = new Library();
        LibraryPatron patron1 = new LibraryPatron("12345");
        LibraryPatron patron2 = new LibraryPatron("67890");

        // Patron1 orders a copy of the book
        patron1.borrowBook(library, "Mystery", "The Hound of the Baskervilles", "Arthur Conan Doyle", "2024-04-30");
        // Patron2 orders another copy of the same book
        patron2.borrowBook(library, "Mystery", "The Hound of the Baskervilles", "Arthur Conan Doyle",

== Design Considerations
When implementing the Flyweight Pattern in software development, several design considerations should be taken into account:

* **Memory Efficiency**: The Flyweight Pattern aims to minimize memory usage by reusing existing instances and sharing common parts among multiple objects. Designers should carefully consider the trade-offs between memory efficiency and performance when deciding which parts of an object should be shared and which should be unique to each instance.
* **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic State**: It's essential to distinguish between intrinsic state (shared across multiple instances) and extrinsic state (unique to each instance) when designing flyweight objects. By separating these states, designers can maximize memory savings while still allowing for customization and variation in object behavior.
* **Thread Safety**: If flyweight objects are accessed concurrently by multiple threads, designers should ensure that access to shared resources is synchronized to prevent data corruption or race conditions. Proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or atomic operations, should be used to ensure thread safety in multithreaded environments.
* **Scalability**: The design should be scalable to accommodate a growing number of flyweight objects and clients. Designers should consider how easily the flyweight factory can be extended to support new types of flyweight objects and how well the system performs under increasing workload or user demand.
* **Performance Overhead**: While the Flyweight Pattern can improve memory efficiency, it may introduce performance overhead due to the additional complexity of managing shared resources and synchronizing access to them. Designers should carefully profile and optimize the implementation to minimize overhead and ensure acceptable performance.
* **Object Identity**: It's important to maintain object identity when reusing flyweight objects. Designers should ensure that clients can reliably distinguish between different instances of flyweight objects, even if they share some common parts or properties.
* **Immutable State**: Flyweight objects should ideally have immutable intrinsic state to prevent unintended modifications and ensure consistency across multiple instances. Designers should carefully design the interface of flyweight objects to enforce immutability and prevent accidental changes to shared state.

== Conclusion
The Flyweight Pattern is a powerful design pattern that enables efficient memory usage and improved performance by reusing existing instances and sharing common parts among multiple objects. By separating intrinsic and extrinsic state, the pattern allows for customization and variation in object behavior while minimizing memory overhead. Designers can use the Flyweight Pattern to build scalable and thread-safe software systems that can handle large numbers of objects efficiently. However, careful consideration should be given to the design and implementation to ensure proper synchronization, object identity, and performance optimization. Overall, the Flyweight Pattern is a valuable tool in the software architect's toolkit, offering a balance between memory efficiency, performance, and scalability.
