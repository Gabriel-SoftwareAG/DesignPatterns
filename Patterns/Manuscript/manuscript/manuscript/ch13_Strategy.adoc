== Introduction

|===
|Imagine you're planning a road trip, and you have different options for getting to your destination. You could take the highway, which is the fastest but may have tolls. Alternatively, you could take scenic routes, which are slower but offer beautiful views. Depending on factors like time, budget, and personal preferences, you might choose different strategies for your journey.

In software design, the strategy pattern works similarly. It allows you to define a family of algorithms, or strategies, for accomplishing a task, and then select the appropriate one at runtime based on specific conditions or requirements. Just like choosing a route for your road trip, you can dynamically select the best strategy for solving a problem based on various factors.

|===

For example, if you're building a navigation app, you could implement different strategies for calculating the fastest route, the shortest route, or the most scenic route to a destination. Depending on user preferences or real-time traffic conditions, the app can switch between these strategies to provide the best possible route for the user's needs.

Overall, the strategy pattern provides flexibility and adaptability in software design by allowing you to encapsulate different algorithms and dynamically select the most suitable one at runtime, just like choosing the best strategy for a road trip based on various factors.

== Key Components

- **Context**: The context is the class or object that interacts with the strategies. In our analogy, the context represents the road trip planner or navigation app that selects the appropriate strategy for the journey.
- **Strategy Interface**: The strategy interface defines the contract for all strategies, specifying the methods that each strategy must implement. In our example, the strategy interface defines methods for calculating routes, such as `calculateRoute()` or `planTrip()`.
- **Concrete Strategies**: Concrete strategies are the different algorithms or approaches for accomplishing the task defined by the strategy interface. In our analogy, concrete strategies represent the various routes or navigation algorithms, such as the highway route, scenic route, fastest route, or shortest route.


== UML Diagrams 
Next, we will explain the concept of the Strategy design pattern using UML.

=== Class Diagram
image::StrategyPatternClassDiagram.png[title="The Strategy Class Diagram"]
In this diagram, let's interpret the Strategy Pattern using the analogy of planning routes for a road trip. The "Context" class represents the road trip planner or navigation app, which selects the appropriate strategy (route) for the journey. The "Strategy" interface defines the contract for all strategies, specifying the method algorithmInterface() that each strategy must implement. Concrete strategies are represented by classes such as "ConcreteStrategyA," "ConcreteStrategyB," and "ConcreteStrategyC," each implementing the Strategy interface with its unique algorithm for planning a route. For example, ConcreteStrategyA could represent the fastest route, ConcreteStrategyB the shortest route, and ConcreteStrategyC the most scenic route. The "Context" class holds a reference to the selected strategy and delegates the route planning task to it. Overall, the Strategy Pattern allows for flexibility and adaptability in selecting the best route for a road trip based on specific conditions or preferences.

=== Sequence Diagram
image::StrategyPatternSequenceDiagram.png[title="The Strategy Sequence Diagram"]
In this sequence diagram, let's interpret the Strategy Pattern using the analogy of planning routes for a road trip. The "Client" represents the user or system interacting with the road trip planner or navigation app, the "Context." The "Context" class holds a reference to the selected strategy (route) and delegates the route planning task to it. Initially, the client sets the strategy to "ConcreteStrategyA" (e.g., the fastest route). The "Context" then creates an instance of "ConcreteStrategyA" and executes its algorithmInterface(), which represents calculating the fastest route. Once completed, the context returns the result to the client. Later, the client changes the strategy to "ConcreteStrategyB" (e.g., the shortest route). Again, the "Context" creates an instance of "ConcreteStrategyB" and executes its algorithmInterface() to calculate the shortest route before returning the result to the client. Overall, the Strategy Pattern allows for dynamic selection and execution of different algorithms (strategies) for solving a problem (planning routes) at runtime.

== Implementation Walkthrough

In this example, we'll implement the Strategy Pattern in Java using the analogy of planning routes for a road trip. We'll have three main classes: `RoutePlanner` (Context), `RouteStrategy` (Strategy interface), and concrete strategy classes such as `FastestRouteStrategy` and `ShortestRouteStrategy`. The `RoutePlanner` class represents the road trip planner or navigation app, while the strategy classes represent different algorithms for planning routes.

=== RoutePlanner (Context) Class

[source,java]
----
public class RoutePlanner {
    private RouteStrategy strategy;

    public void setStrategy(RouteStrategy strategy) {
        this.strategy = strategy;
    }

    public void executeStrategy() {
        strategy.calculateRoute();
    }
}
----

The `RoutePlanner` class is the context that interacts with different route planning strategies. It holds a reference to the current strategy and delegates the route planning task to it.

=== RouteStrategy (Strategy) Interface

[source,java]
----
public interface RouteStrategy {
    void calculateRoute();
}
----

The `RouteStrategy` interface defines the contract for all route planning strategies. It specifies the `calculateRoute()` method that each strategy must implement.

=== FastestRouteStrategy and ShortestRouteStrategy (Concrete Strategies) Classes

[source,java]
----
public class FastestRouteStrategy implements RouteStrategy {
    public void calculateRoute() {
        System.out.println("Calculating the fastest route...");
        // Implementation for calculating the fastest route
    }
}

public class ShortestRouteStrategy implements RouteStrategy {
    public void calculateRoute() {
        System.out.println("Calculating the shortest route...");
        // Implementation for calculating the shortest route
    }
}
----

The `FastestRouteStrategy` and `ShortestRouteStrategy` classes are concrete implementations of the `RouteStrategy` interface. They represent different algorithms for planning routes, such as finding the fastest or shortest route.

=== Usage Example

Now, let's see how the classes are used together:

[source,java]
----
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RoutePlanner planner = new RoutePlanner();

        // Set the strategy to calculate the fastest route
        planner.setStrategy(new FastestRouteStrategy());
        planner.executeStrategy();

        // Set the strategy to calculate the shortest route
        planner.setStrategy(new ShortestRouteStrategy());
        planner.executeStrategy();
    }
}
----

In this example, we create a `RoutePlanner` object representing the road trip planner. We then set the strategy to calculate the fastest route and execute it. After that, we set the strategy to calculate the shortest route and execute it. Each time, the context delegates the route planning task to the selected strategy, resulting in different route calculations based on the chosen strategy.

== Design Considerations

When implementing the Strategy Pattern in software development, several design considerations should be taken into account:

* **Encapsulation of Algorithms**: Ensure that each algorithm is encapsulated in its own strategy class, adhering to the single responsibility principle. This promotes modularity and maintainability by allowing strategies to be added, removed, or modified independently.
* **Interface Design**: Design the strategy interface carefully to define a common contract for all strategies. This contract should specify the methods that each strategy must implement, promoting consistency and interoperability between different strategies.
* **Dynamic Strategy Selection**: Implement mechanisms for dynamically selecting strategies at runtime based on specific conditions or user preferences. This allows for flexibility and adaptability in the application, enabling different strategies to be applied based on changing requirements or scenarios.
* **Performance Considerations**: Consider the performance implications of using different strategies, especially in scenarios where computation-intensive algorithms are involved. Evaluate the trade-offs between different strategies in terms of execution time and resource utilization to ensure optimal performance.
* **Testing and Validation**: Test each strategy independently to ensure correctness and effectiveness in achieving its intended purpose. Additionally, validate the behavior of the context class when interacting with different strategies to ensure proper integration and functionality.


== Conclusion

The Strategy Pattern is a versatile and powerful design pattern that provides flexibility and adaptability in software design. By encapsulating each algorithm in separate strategy classes and allowing the context to switch between strategies at runtime, the pattern enables dynamic selection and execution of different algorithms for solving a problem. This promotes modularity, maintainability, and extensibility in software systems, allowing strategies to be added, removed, or modified independently without affecting the overall system architecture. Overall, the Strategy Pattern is a valuable tool for managing algorithmic variations and promoting code reuse in object-oriented programming.
