== Introduction
[cols="2", frame="none", grid="none"]
|===
|Let's consider the process of building a house. There are several steps involved, such as laying the foundation, constructing the walls, installing the roof, and finishing the interior. While these steps are common to every house construction project, the specific materials, techniques, and designs may vary depending on factors like the location, budget, and architectural style.

In software design, the Template Method pattern can be applied to model the construction process of a house. You can create a generic "HouseBuilder" class with a template method that outlines the overall sequence of construction steps. The template method would include fixed steps such as laying the foundation, constructing the walls, and installing the roof, while leaving certain steps open for customization through abstract methods or hooks.

|===

For example, subclasses for building different types of houses, such as a modern-style house or a traditional-style house, can extend the "HouseBuilder" class and override specific steps to implement unique construction techniques or architectural features. While both types of houses follow the same overall construction process, they can differ in the choice of materials, design elements, and finishing touches.

The Template Method pattern provides a flexible and reusable way to define the overall structure of a complex process, allowing subclasses to customize specific steps to meet varying requirements or preferences, similar to how different types of houses can be built using a common construction framework with room for customization based on architectural style and design preferences.

== Key Components
* _HouseBuilder Class (Abstract Base Class)_: Represents the template method itself, defining the skeleton of the algorithm for building a house. It includes steps that are common and fixed in the process, such as laying the foundation, constructing the walls, and installing the roof. These steps are implemented as individual methods within the class, some of which may be defined as abstract methods to force subclasses to provide specific implementations.

* _ConcreteHouseBuilder Subclasses_: These are specific implementations of the HouseBuilder class, such as ModernHouseBuilder or TraditionalHouseBuilder. Each subclass overrides the abstract methods or hooks provided by the HouseBuilder class to implement steps in the construction process that vary between different types of houses. For instance, the material selection for walls, roof designs, and interior finishing techniques can differ significantly between a modern and a traditional house.

* _Template Method_: This is a method within the HouseBuilder class that outlines the sequence of steps for building a house. It calls the step-specific methods in a particular order, ensuring that the base structure of the process is always followed. The template method itself is invariant, meaning it does not change when subclasses extend the base class, ensuring that the core structure of the algorithm is preserved.

* _Customizable Steps (Hooks/Abstract Methods)_: Within the HouseBuilder class, certain steps are left intentionally undefined (abstract) or minimally defined (hooks) to allow subclasses to tailor these steps according to specific requirements. This design allows for flexibility and customization in the construction process, enabling the creation of houses with different architectural styles and features while adhering to a standard construction sequence.

== UML Diagrams 
Next, we will explain the concept of the Template Method design pattern using UML.


[discrete%breakable]
=== Class Diagram
image::TemplateMethodPatternClassDiagram.png[title="The Template Method Class Diagram", align=center]
In the given UML diagram, we see the Template Method design pattern represented through classes that resemble the process of constructing a house, using an analogy to explain each class's role. The `AbstractClass` acts as the blueprint or the general contractor for building a house, defining the overall sequence of construction steps (`templateMethod()`) and specifying that certain tasks (like laying the foundation `primitiveOperation1()` and installing the roof `primitiveOperation2()`) need customization but does not dictate how to perform these tasks. This class mandates that any specific construction project (house) must define how these tasks are carried out. The `ConcreteClass1` and `ConcreteClass2` are akin to specialized builders or construction teams for different styles of houses, say a modern-style home and a traditional-style home, respectively. These classes provide concrete implementations for the foundation-laying and roof-installing steps (`primitiveOperation1()` and `primitiveOperation2()`) according to the requirements or design specifics of the house they are tasked to build. The relationship arrows indicate that both specialized builders inherit the overall construction plan from the general contractor but tailor specific steps based on the architectural style and construction techniques suitable for the type of house being constructed.

=== Sequence Diagram
image::TemplateMethodPatternSequenceDiagram.png[title="The Template Method Sequence Diagram", align=center]
This sequence diagram illustrates the interaction between different components in the Template Method design pattern. The Client represents the homeowner or project manager, initiating the construction process by calling the `templateMethod()` on the `AbstractClass`, which acts as the general blueprint or construction guideline for building a house. This blueprint outlines the necessary steps for construction but delegates the specifics of some steps to its subclasses.

The `AbstractClass` then coordinates the construction process by engaging two different types of specialized construction teams, represented by `ConcreteClass1` and `ConcreteClass2`. These could be likened to teams specializing in different styles of houses or different construction tasks. For instance, `ConcreteClass1` might be a team skilled in laying foundations and `ConcreteClass2` skilled in roof installations, or they might represent teams building in modern and traditional styles, respectively.

The process begins with the `AbstractClass` directing `ConcreteClass1` to perform `primitiveOperation1()`, perhaps laying the foundation in a specific manner suited to its expertise. Once `ConcreteClass1` reports completion, the `AbstractClass` similarly instructs `ConcreteClass2` to perform the same operation (`primitiveOperation1()`), adapted to its unique style or method.

Following the foundation work, the `AbstractClass` then orchestrates both teams to carry out `primitiveOperation2()`, which could involve installing roofs, again allowing each class to apply its specific techniques or materials suited to the style of house being constructed.

The sequence of calls and responses between the `AbstractClass` and the concrete classes demonstrates the template method pattern's power to outline a standard process while accommodating customization in the execution of certain steps, ensuring that regardless of the style or specific techniques employed by the construction teams, the overall process adheres to a unified construction plan set forth by the `AbstractClass`.

== Implementation Walkthrough
This example demonstrates how to use the Template Method Pattern to model a house construction process. The process is outlined in an abstract `HouseBuilder` class (analogous to `AbstractClass` in the UML diagrams), which defines the template method for building a house. Specific steps like laying the foundation and installing the roof are implemented by concrete classes (`ConcreteClass1` and `ConcreteClass2`), representing different styles of houses or construction teams with unique expertise.

== Design Considerations
When applying the Template Method Pattern, several design considerations should be taken into account to ensure its effective use and integration into your software design. Firstly, it's crucial to **distinguish between steps that are invariant (fixed) and those that are variant (subject to change) across different implementations**. The invariant steps are implemented directly within the template method in the abstract class, ensuring a consistent process flow. In contrast, the variant steps are abstracted out, allowing subclasses to provide specific implementations.

Another important consideration is **the use of hooks**. Hooks are optional steps defined in the abstract class, providing a default implementation that subclasses may override. This technique allows for greater flexibility, enabling subclasses to extend the algorithm's behavior without altering its structure.

Moreover, it's essential to ensure that the template method itself is marked as final to prevent subclasses from altering the sequence of steps. This maintains the integrity of the algorithm's structure, which is central to the pattern's intent.

The choice between using abstract methods versus providing a default implementation (hooks) for customizable steps depends on whether you want to enforce that a step is always overridden (use abstract methods) or provide a default behavior that might suffice for some subclasses (use hooks).

Lastly, consider the principle of **least knowledge** (also known as Demeter's Law) to minimize direct collaborations between classes, which can lead to a more decoupled and maintainable codebase. In the context of the Template Method Pattern, this often means that the abstract class should not have detailed knowledge of the subclasses' internal workings, focusing instead on orchestrating the steps of the algorithm.

These considerations are pivotal in leveraging the Template Method Pattern effectively, enabling the development of flexible, reusable, and maintainable software systems that encapsulate complex algorithms or processes.


[discrete%breakable]
== Conclusion
The Template Method Pattern offers a robust framework for encapsulating the skeleton of an algorithm, process, or workflow within a base class while allowing subclasses to customize specific steps without changing the overall structure. This pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where the sequence of operations is fixed, but the actual implementation of one or more steps can vary. By defining invariant parts of the algorithm once and allowing variant behaviors to be implemented by subclasses, the Template Method Pattern promotes code reuse and adherence to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.

Furthermore, by encouraging the use of inheritance and providing a clear protocol for extending functionalities, the Template Method Pattern helps maintain a well-organized and decoupled codebase. It encourages thinking in terms of high-level workflows, making it easier to comprehend and maintain complex logic.

The Template Method Pattern is a powerful tool in the object-oriented design toolbox, offering a structured approach to defining algorithms with customizable steps. When applied judiciously, it can greatly enhance the flexibility, reusability, and maintainability of software, making it an essential pattern for developers to understand and utilize effectively.
