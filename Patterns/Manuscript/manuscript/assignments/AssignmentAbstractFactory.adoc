= Home Assignment: Implementing the Abstract Factory Pattern in Java with Real-life Example

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Abstract Factory design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of providing an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

== Instructions

1. Imagine you are the owner of a fashion design studio specializing in custom-made outfits.
2. Create a Java project named "FashionDesignStudio" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
3. Implement the Abstract Factory design pattern with the following components:

=== OutfitFactory
An abstract class or interface defining methods for creating different types of outfits, such as tops and bottoms.

=== CasualOutfitFactory, FormalOutfitFactory
Concrete subclasses of OutfitFactory that implement methods to create specific types of outfits suitable for casual and formal occasions, respectively.

=== Top, Bottom
Abstract classes or interfaces representing different components of an outfit, with methods for designing and customizing the outfit.

=== CasualTop, CasualBottom, FormalTop, FormalBottom
Concrete subclasses of Top and Bottom representing specific types of casual and formal tops and bottoms.

4. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
5. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
6. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
7. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
8. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
9. Implement the Abstract Factory pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- As the owner of the fashion design studio, you cater to clients with different preferences for outfits, including casual and formal wear.
- Implement concrete factories such as CasualOutfitFactory and FormalOutfitFactory that create specific types of outfits suitable for casual and formal occasions, respectively.
- Use the Abstract Factory pattern to create instances of these outfits, consisting of tops and bottoms, designed according to the client's specifications.

10. Test your implementation by creating instances of different types of outfits using the respective factories.
11. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
12. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
13. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing a FashionDesignStudio using the Abstract Factory pattern in Java with a real-life example!
