= Home Assignment: Implementing the Bridge Pattern in Java with Real-life Example

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Bridge design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of separating an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

== Instructions

1. Imagine you are a toy manufacturer creating a line of remote-controlled cars.
2. Create a Java project named "RemoteControlCars" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
3. Implement the Bridge design pattern with the following components:

=== Car
An interface representing a remote-controlled car, with methods for driving forward, backward, turning left, and turning right.

=== RemoteControl
An interface representing a remote control for the car, with methods for controlling the car's movements.

=== RemoteControlImpl
A concrete class implementing the RemoteControl interface, which contains a reference to the Car interface and delegates the control commands to the car.

=== CarModel
An interface representing different models of remote-controlled cars, with methods for specifying car features such as speed and color.

=== CarImpl
A concrete class implementing the Car interface, which represents a specific model of remote-controlled car. It contains the implementation details of how the car moves and turns.

4. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
5. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
6. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
7. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
8. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
9. Implement the Bridge pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- As a toy manufacturer, you want to create a line of remote-controlled cars with different models and control mechanisms.
- Implement a Car interface with methods for driving and turning the car.
- Create a RemoteControl interface representing a remote control for the car, with methods for controlling the car's movements.
- Implement a RemoteControlImpl class that contains a reference to the Car interface and delegates control commands to the car.
- Implement a CarModel interface representing different models of remote-controlled cars, with methods for specifying car features such as speed and color.
- Create a CarImpl class representing a specific model of remote-controlled car, with the implementation details of how the car moves and turns.

10. Test your implementation by creating instances of RemoteControl and different Car models, and controlling the cars using the remote control.
11. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
12. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
13. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing RemoteControlCars using the Bridge pattern in Java with a real-life example!
