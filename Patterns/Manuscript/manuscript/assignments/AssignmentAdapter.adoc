= Home Assignment: Implementing the Adapter Pattern in Java with Real-life Example

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Adapter design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of allowing objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

== Instructions

1. Imagine you are the owner of a vintage vinyl record store, and you want to digitize your collection for online sales.
2. Create a Java project named "VinylRecordStore" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
3. Implement the Adapter design pattern with the following components:

=== RecordPlayer
An interface representing a vinyl record player, with methods for playing and stopping the record.

=== ModernMediaPlayer
An interface representing a modern digital media player, with methods for playing and pausing digital audio files.

=== RecordPlayerAdapter
A class that implements the ModernMediaPlayer interface and adapts the RecordPlayer interface to work with modern media players.

4. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
5. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
6. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
7. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
8. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
9. Implement the Adapter pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- As the owner of the vintage vinyl record store, you have a collection of classic vinyl records that you want to digitize and sell online.
- Implement a RecordPlayer interface with methods for playing and stopping the vinyl record.
- Implement a ModernMediaPlayer interface with methods for playing and pausing digital audio files.
- Create a RecordPlayerAdapter class that adapts the RecordPlayer interface to work with the ModernMediaPlayer interface, allowing you to play vinyl records on modern media players.

10. Test your implementation by creating instances of the RecordPlayerAdapter and using it to play vinyl records on modern media players.
11. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
12. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
13. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing a VinylRecordStore using the Adapter pattern in Java with a real-life example!
