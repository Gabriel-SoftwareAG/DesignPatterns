= Home Assignment: Implementing the Observer Pattern in Java

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Observer design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of the relationship between subjects and observers.

== Instructions

1. Create a Java project named "WeatherStation" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
2. Implement the Observer design pattern with the following components:

=== WeatherStation
The subject that provides temperature updates to various displays.

=== WeatherDisplay
The observer interface that defines the update method, which is called by the subject to notify displays of temperature changes.

=== CurrentConditionsDisplay, StatisticsDisplay, and ForecastDisplay
Concrete implementations of the WeatherDisplay interface that receive temperature updates from the WeatherStation and display them in different ways.

3. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
4. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
5. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
6. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
7. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
8. Implement the Observer pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- Imagine a weather station that provides temperature updates to various displays.
- The weather station is the subject, and the displays are observers.
- Each display (observer) should receive temperature updates from the weather station (subject) and display them.

9. Test your implementation by creating a simple application that simulates temperature updates and displays them on different types of displays.
10. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
11. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
12. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing a weather station using the Observer pattern in Java!
