= Home Assignment: The Builder Pattern for API Requests

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Builder design pattern in Java for constructing API request objects.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of separating the construction of complex objects from their representation.

== Instructions

1. Create a Java project named "ApiRequestBuilder" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
2. Implement the Builder design pattern with the following components:

=== ApiRequest
The class that represents an API request object, containing fields such as:
  - URL: The endpoint URL of the API.
  - Method: The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) used for the request.
  - Headers: Any additional headers to be included in the request.
  - Parameters: Any query parameters to be sent with the request.
  - Body: The request body, if applicable.

=== ApiRequestBuilder
The builder class that constructs and assembles parts of the ApiRequest object.

3. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
4. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
5. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
6. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
7. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
8. Implement the Builder pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- Implement an ApiRequestBuilder class to construct API request objects with different properties such as:
  - Setting the URL of the API endpoint.
  - Specifying the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) to be used.
  - Adding headers to the request.
  - Setting query parameters for the request.
  - Providing a request body, if applicable.

9. Test your implementation by using the ApiRequestBuilder to construct various API request objects with different configurations.
10. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
11. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
12. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing an ApiRequestBuilder class using the Builder pattern in Java!
