= Home Assignment: Implementing the Facade Pattern in Java with Real-life Example

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Facade design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of providing a simplified interface to a larger body of code.

== Instructions

1. Imagine you are a travel booking platform that provides various services for travelers.
2. Create a Java project named "TravelBooking" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
3. Implement the Facade design pattern with the following components:

=== TravelBookingFacade
A facade class that provides a simplified interface for booking travel services, such as flights, hotels, and rental cars.

=== FlightBookingSystem, HotelBookingSystem, RentalCarBookingSystem
Subsystem classes that handle specific aspects of booking travel services, such as flights, hotels, and rental cars.

4. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
5. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
6. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
7. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
8. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
9. Implement the Facade pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- As a travel booking platform, you want to provide travelers with a simple interface for booking flights, hotels, and rental cars.
- Implement a TravelBookingFacade class that acts as a facade for the travel booking system, providing methods for booking flights, hotels, and rental cars.
- Create FlightBookingSystem, HotelBookingSystem, and RentalCarBookingSystem classes representing subsystems that handle specific aspects of booking travel services.
- Use the Facade pattern to hide the complexities of interacting with the subsystems and provide a simplified interface for travelers to book their travel services.

10. Test your implementation by creating instances of TravelBookingFacade and booking flights, hotels, and rental cars using the facade methods.
11. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
12. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
13. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing TravelBooking using the Facade pattern in Java with a real-life example!
