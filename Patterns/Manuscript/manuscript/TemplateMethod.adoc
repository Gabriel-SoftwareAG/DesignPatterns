|Let's consider the process of building a house. There are several steps involved, such as laying the foundation, constructing the walls, installing the roof, and finishing the interior. While these steps are common to every house construction project, the specific materials, techniques, and designs may vary depending on factors like the location, budget, and architectural style.

In software design, the Template Method pattern can be applied to model the construction process of a house. You can create a generic "HouseBuilder" class with a template method that outlines the overall sequence of construction steps. The template method would include fixed steps such as laying the foundation, constructing the walls, and installing the roof, while leaving certain steps open for customization through abstract methods or hooks.

For example, subclasses for building different types of houses, such as a modern-style house or a traditional-style house, can extend the "HouseBuilder" class and override specific steps to implement unique construction techniques or architectural features. While both types of houses follow the same overall construction process, they can differ in the choice of materials, design elements, and finishing touches.

Overall, the Template Method pattern provides a flexible and reusable way to define the overall structure of a complex process, allowing subclasses to customize specific steps to meet varying requirements or preferences, similar to how different types of houses can be built using a common construction framework with room for customization based on architectural style and design preferences.
