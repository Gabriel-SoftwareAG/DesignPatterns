== Introduction
[cols="<1,>m"]
|===
|Imagine you're traveling to a foreign country where you don't speak the language. To communicate with locals, you hire an interpreter who translates your words into the local language and vice versa.

In software design, the interpreter pattern works similarly. It's used to interpret or evaluate expressions written in a specific language. Just like a human interpreter translates between languages, a software interpreter translates between different languages or formats within a computer program.

|===

For example, let's say you're building a calculator application that can evaluate mathematical expressions. You can implement an interpreter that understands mathematical expressions written in a specific format, such as infix notation (e.g., "2 + 3 * 5"). The interpreter parses these expressions, evaluates them according to mathematical rules, and returns the result.

Similarly, interpreters can be used in other domains, such as parsing and evaluating programming languages, querying databases, or processing markup languages like XML or JSON. In each case, the interpreter pattern provides a way to interpret expressions or commands written in a specific format and perform the necessary actions based on that interpretation.

Overall, the interpreter pattern enables the processing of expressions or commands written in a specific language or format within a computer program, similar to how a human interpreter translates between languages to facilitate communication between people.

== Key Components
- _AbstractExpression_: This component represents the expression interface that declares an interpret operation. Just like a human interpreter who understands and translates languages, the AbstractExpression in the interpreter pattern provides the foundation for interpreting various expressions in a specific language or format. Each concrete expression in the program must implement this interface.

- _TerminalExpression_: A class that implements the AbstractExpression interface for interpreting terminal expressions in the language. In the analogy, this would be akin to interpreting basic words or phrases that don't need further decomposition. For a calculator application, TerminalExpression might interpret individual numbers.

- _NonTerminalExpression_: This class also implements the AbstractExpression interface but is used for interpreting expressions that are composed of multiple expressions. Similar to complex sentences that require contextual understanding in language translation, NonTerminalExpression handles the logic for combining or processing multiple TerminalExpressions or NonTerminalExpressions according to the rules of the language or format.

- _Context_: Represents the context of the interpretation, containing information that's global to the interpreter. In our travel analogy, this could be akin to the specific details or rules of grammar and syntax of the local language that the interpreter must understand. In software, Context might include the specifics of the expression format or the environment in which the expression should be evaluated.

- _Client_: The client utilizes the interpreter. It constructs the necessary expressions and calls the interpret method to evaluate or process the expression. Just like a traveler who forms sentences to communicate a message and relies on the interpreter to translate, the Client in the pattern constructs expressions using the language or format understood by the interpreter to achieve a specific outcome, such as calculating the result of a mathematical expression.

== UML Diagrams 
Next, we will explain the concept of the Interpreter design pattern using UML.

=== Class Diagram
image::InterpreterPatternClassDiagram.png[title="The Interpreter Class Diagram", align=center, scaledwidth=70%]
Using the Interpreter Pattern class diagram, and our traveler analogy, imagine you're in a foreign country trying to communicate with locals using a language you don't understand. The `AbstractExpression` class represents the concept of language itself, providing a template for interpreting expressions within a specific context. It's akin to the framework of language rules and grammar. The `TerminalExpression` class embodies simple phrases or words in the language that can be directly translated, much like basic vocabulary. On the other hand, the `NonterminalExpression` class represents more complex language constructs, akin to compound sentences or idiomatic expressions that require interpretation beyond literal translation. The `Context` class serves as the environment or setting in which expressions are interpreted, analogous to the cultural or situational context affecting language usage. Finally, the `Client` class acts as the traveler or communicator, utilizing the `AbstractExpression` to convey messages within the given context. It's as if the traveler employs the language framework to communicate effectively with locals.

=== Sequence Diagram
image::InterpreterPatternSequenceDiagram.png[title="The Interpreter Sequence Diagram", align=center, scaledwidth=90%]
In the Interpreter Pattern sequence diagram, the Client represents you, the traveler, attempting to convey a message. The `Context` is the immediate environment or situation in which you're communicating, influencing how your message is interpreted. The `Interpreter` acts as the intermediary, much like a language interpreter hired to translate between you and the locals. It coordinates the interpretation process. When the Client requests interpretation, the `Context` activates and passes the expression to the `Interpreter`. The `Interpreter` then determines whether the expression is a `TerminalExpression` — a simple phrase — or a `NonterminalExpression` — a more complex statement. It delegates interpretation accordingly, activating the appropriate class to process the expression. Once interpreted, the `Interpreter` sends the result back to the `Context`, which then delivers it to the Client, completing the communication loop.

== Implementation Walkthrough
In this example, we'll implement an interpreter pattern to demonstrate how a language analogy can be applied to software design. We'll use the analogy of a traveler communicating in a foreign country to explain each component of the design.

Client: Sending expression - Hello
Interpreter: Translated expression - Bonjour
Client: Sending expression - How are you?
Interpreter: Expression not recognized

== Design Considerations
When implementing the interpreter pattern, several design considerations should be taken into account:

* **Flexibility**: The pattern should allow for easy addition or modification of language expressions without requiring extensive changes to the existing codebase. This flexibility ensures that the system can accommodate new language constructs or variations in expression formats.

* **Scalability**: As the system grows, it should be able to handle a larger number of expressions efficiently. Considerations should be made to optimize the performance of expression interpretation, especially when dealing with complex or frequently used expressions.

* **Separation of Concerns**: It's important to maintain separation between the interpreter logic and the application-specific functionality. This separation allows for easier maintenance, testing, and reuse of the interpreter components across different contexts or applications.


[discrete%breakable]
== Conclusion
The interpreter pattern provides a powerful solution for implementing language interpretation and expression evaluation within software systems. The pattern allows for the translation of expressions between different languages or formats. Through careful design considerations such as flexibility, scalability, and separation of concerns, the interpreter pattern enables the development of robust and maintainable systems capable of interpreting a wide range of expressions. Whether used in parsing programming languages, querying databases, or processing markup languages, the interpreter pattern remains a valuable tool for facilitating communication between different components of a software system.
