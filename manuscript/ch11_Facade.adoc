== Introduction
[cols="<1,>m"]
|===
| Let's say you have a high-tech car with lots of advanced features like automatic parking, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems. Now, instead of having to understand how each of these systems works under the hood, you have a simplified control panel with buttons labeled "Park Assist," "Cruise Control," and "Collision Avoidance."

This control panel acts as a facade, providing you with a straightforward interface to interact with these complex systems without needing to understand all the intricate details of how they function.

|===

So, just like the facade of a building hides its inner complexities, the control panel facade hides the complexities of the car's advanced features, making them more accessible and easier to use for the driver.

== Key Components
- _Facade_: The facade acts as a simplified interface to a complex system, providing a unified and straightforward access point for interacting with multiple subsystems. In our analogy, the control panel facade hides the complexities of the car's advanced features, such as automatic parking, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems, from the driver.
- _Subsystem_: Subsystems are individual components or systems that make up the larger, complex system. In our example, the automatic parking system, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems represent subsystems of the high-tech car.

== UML Diagrams 
Next, we will explain the concept of the Facade design pattern using UML.

=== Class Diagram
image::FacadePatternClassDiagram.png[title="The Facade Class Diagram", align=center]
In this class diagram, the `Facade` class represents the control panel, which provides a simplified interface for accessing the functionalities of the car's advanced features. It holds references to three subsystems: `SubsystemClassA`, `SubsystemClassB`, and `SubsystemClassC`, which represent the automatic parking, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems, respectively. Each subsystem encapsulates the complex functionalities of its corresponding feature. The control panel facade delegates operations to these subsystems as needed. For example, when the driver presses the "Park Assist" button on the control panel, the facade invokes the appropriate operation in `SubsystemClassA` to activate the automatic parking system. Similarly, the facade interacts with `SubsystemClassB` and `SubsystemClassC` to control the adaptive cruise control and collision avoidance systems, respectively. 


[discrete%breakable]
=== Sequence Diagram
image::FacadePatternSequenceDiagram.png[title="The Facade Sequence Diagram", align=center]
In this sequence diagram, the Client represents the driver interacting with the control panel to perform actions. When the driver initiates an action, such as activating a feature like automatic parking or adaptive cruise control, the request is forwarded to the `Facade` class, which represents the control panel. The facade then delegates the action to the appropriate subsystems: `SubsystemClassA`, `SubsystemClassB`, and `SubsystemClassC`, which represent the automatic parking, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems, respectively. Each subsystem performs its specific action and returns the result to the facade. Finally, the facade aggregates the results and sends the action result back to the client.

== Implementation Walkthrough
In this example, we'll implement the Facade Pattern using our analogy of a control panel. We'll have four main classes: `ControlPanel`, `AutomaticParkingSystem`, `AdaptiveCruiseControlSystem`, and `CollisionAvoidanceSystem`. The `ControlPanel` class represents the facade, providing a simplified interface for interacting with the car's advanced features, while the subsystems represent the automatic parking, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance systems.

=== Usage Example

[source, {lang}]
----
ifeval::["{lang}" == "java"]
include::{java_path}/facade/Client.java[lines=3..]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{lang}" == "python"]
include::{python_path}/facade/Client.py[lines=3..]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{lang}" == "csharp"]
include::{csharp_path}/facade/Client.cs[lines=3..]
endif::[]

ifeval::["{lang}" == "typescript"]
include::{typescript_path}/facade/Client.ts[lines=3..]
endif::[]
----

In this example, we create a `ControlPanel` object representing the control panel in the car. The driver uses the control panel to interact with the car's advanced features, such as parking the car automatically, activating adaptive cruise control, and avoiding collisions. The driver can also tie all these activities together, when using the `driveToHomeAndPark()` method, which interacts between all the different subsystem, while simplifying it's use to the driver.

The above code output is:

== Design Considerations
When implementing the Facade Pattern, several design considerations should be taken into account:

* **Simplicity and Usability**: The primary goal of the Facade Pattern is to provide a simplified interface for interacting with a complex system. Designers should prioritize simplicity and usability when designing the facade, ensuring that it hides the complexity of the underlying subsystems and presents a straightforward interface for users.
* **Subsystem Encapsulation**: Subsystems should encapsulate their specific functionalities and complexities, allowing the facade to delegate tasks to them seamlessly. Designers should carefully define the responsibilities and interfaces of each subsystem to maintain modularity and minimize dependencies between subsystems.
* **Flexibility and Extensibility**: The Facade Pattern should allow for flexibility and extensibility in adding new features or modifying existing ones. Designers should ensure that the facade remains open for extension but closed for modification, enabling the addition of new subsystems or features without modifying the existing code.
* **Performance Considerations**: While the Facade Pattern simplifies the interaction with a complex system, designers should consider the performance implications of using the pattern. Facade operations should be efficient and lightweight, minimizing overhead and latency to ensure optimal system performance.


[discrete%breakable]
== Conclusion
The Facade Pattern simplifies interactions with complex systems by offering a unified and straightforward interface. This approach not only enhances usability but also lowers the cognitive load for users, facilitating easier management of the system's advanced features. It also improves modularity, maintainability, and flexibility by hiding the complexities of subsystems and reducing component dependencies. As a powerful tool in software design, the Facade Pattern enables intuitive and user-friendly system interactions, allowing users to efficiently handle complex functionalities.
