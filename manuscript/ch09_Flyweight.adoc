== Introduction
[cols="<1,>m"]
|===
|The flyweight design pattern is similar to sharing books in a library. It involves maximizing resource utilization through sharing. Just as a library allows multiple readers to share a single copy of a book instead of each person needing a personal copy, the flyweight pattern enables sharing of common state objects to minimize memory usage in software applications. This pattern is particularly useful when a large number of objects with identical or similar state information are required (like the books in the library). It works by separating the intrinsic state (the unchanging part) of the object, which is shared, from the extrinsic state (the changing part), which is kept external. By doing so, the flyweight design pattern allows for a reduction in the number of instantiated objects, thus optimizing both memory and processing resources in software systems.

== Key Components

*Flyweight*: Represents the shared books in a library, such as popular titles in genres like mystery, romance, science, and history. These are common and reusable resources in the library, similar to the intrinsic state in flyweights that is shared among multiple borrowers.

*Concrete Flyweight*: Acts as the specific copy of a book in the shared collection, capable of accepting unique settings like current borrower or due date. These reflect the flyweight's capability to handle external states passed in by the borrower.

*Flyweight Factory*: Manages the cataloging and distribution of library books. It ensures that each book is cataloged only once and reused wherever needed, similar to a system that checks if a specific book is already available before acquiring another copy.

*Client*: The library patron who borrows the books. The client decides what books to borrow and for how long, specifying any unique attributes (extrinsic state) such as due dates or special handling requests.

*Extrinsic State*: Involves the specific details associated with each borrowing of the book, such as the borrower's ID and the due date. This state is managed by the borrower and differs with each use of the book, unlike the shared book itself.

== UML Diagrams 
Next, we will explain the concept of the Flyweight design pattern using UML.


[discrete%breakable]
=== Class Diagram
image::FlyweightPatternClassDiagram.png[title="The Flyweight Class Diagram", align=center]
In this class diagram, the `Flyweight` interface represents a type of book, defining the operation to perform. The `ConcreteFlyweight` class represents a specific genre of book, like mystery or romance, storing intrinsic state (such as title or author) that is shareable across many copies. The `FlyweightFactory` class acts as a library book management system, managing different genres of books and cataloging them as needed to ensure they are shared properly. Finally, the Client class represents a library patron, maintaining extrinsic state (unique for each book, like borrower ID or due date) and passing it to the book's checkout process. By using this pattern, you can achieve a comprehensive lending system with a variety of books while minimizing resource usage and improving efficiency by reusing common book genres.


[discrete%breakable]
=== Sequence Diagram
image::FlyweightPatternSequenceDiagram.png[title="The Flyweight Sequence Diagram", align=center]
In this sequence diagram, the Client represents a library patron, while the `FlyweightFactory` acts as a library management system that catalogs different types of books. When the client requests a book with specific intrinsic state (such as genre or author), the factory checks if a book with that intrinsic state already exists. If it does, the factory returns the existing book to the client. If not, the factory creates a new catalog entry for the book with the given intrinsic state and returns it to the client. The client then performs an operation on the book, potentially using both intrinsic and extrinsic state (unique to each book, like borrower ID or due date). This pattern allows for the efficient use of memory and resources by reusing existing books where possible and creating new catalog entries only when needed.

== Implementation Walkthrough
In this example, we demonstate the use of the Flyweight Pattern in a library book management system. The system is designed to efficiently manage and share library books among multiple patrons, minimizing memory usage and optimizing resource allocation.

=== Flyweight Interface (Book)
The `Book` interface is essential in our implementation. It outlines the necessary methods that all book types in the system must implement, focusing on operations related to checking out and returning books.

== Design Considerations
When implementing the Flyweight Pattern in software development, several design considerations should be taken into account:

* **Memory Efficiency**: The Flyweight Pattern aims to minimize memory usage by reusing existing instances and sharing common parts among multiple objects. Designers should carefully consider the trade-offs between memory efficiency and performance when deciding which parts of an object should be shared and which should be unique to each instance.
* **Intrinsic vs. Extrinsic State**: Its essential to distinguish between intrinsic state (shared across multiple instances) and extrinsic state (unique to each instance) when designing flyweight objects. By separating these states, designers can maximize memory savings while still allowing for customization and variation in object behavior.
* **Thread Safety**: If flyweight objects are accessed concurrently by multiple threads, designers should ensure that access to shared resources is synchronized to prevent data corruption or race conditions. Proper synchronization mechanisms, such as locks or atomic operations, should be used to ensure thread safety in multithreaded environments.
* **Scalability**: The design should be scalable to accommodate a growing number of flyweight objects and clients. Designers should consider how easily the flyweight factory can be extended to support new types of flyweight objects and how well the system performs under increasing workload or user demand.
* **Performance Overhead**: While the Flyweight Pattern can improve memory efficiency, it may introduce performance overhead due to the additional complexity of managing shared resources and synchronizing access to them. Designers should carefully profile and optimize the implementation to minimize overhead and ensure acceptable performance.
* **Object Identity**: Its important to maintain object identity when reusing flyweight objects. Designers should ensure that clients can reliably distinguish between different instances of flyweight objects, even if they share some common parts or properties.
* **Immutable State**: Flyweight objects should ideally have immutable intrinsic state to prevent unintended modifications and ensure consistency across multiple instances. Designers should carefully design the interface of flyweight objects to enforce immutability and prevent accidental changes to shared state.

== Conclusion
The Flyweight Pattern is an effective design strategy that enhances performance and memory efficiency by reusing existing instances and sharing common components across multiple objects. It achieves this by distinguishing between intrinsic and extrinsic states, enabling variations in object behavior while reducing memory consumption. This pattern is particularly useful for creating scalable and thread-safe software systems capable of managing a large volume of objects efficiently. However, its design and implementation require meticulous attention to ensure appropriate synchronization, object identity, and performance enhancement. Overall, the Flyweight Pattern serves as an essential resource for software architects, providing a means to balance memory efficiency, performance, and scalability.
