==  Template Method Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

* To understand and implement the Template Method design pattern.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of how to define the skeleton of an algorithm in a method, deferring some steps to subclasses.

=== Instructions

- Create a project named "TemplateMethodExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Template Method design pattern with the following components:

==== Abstract Class
An abstract class that defines the template method and the skeleton of an algorithm. This class should contain the template method which calls other methods, some of which may be abstract and implemented by subclasses.

==== Concrete Classes
Subclasses that extend the abstract class and implement the abstract methods defined in the abstract class to complete the algorithm's steps.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Template Method pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
Implement a `Game` abstract class with a method `play()` that defines the steps to play a game. Create concrete classes like `Chess` and `Soccer` that implement these steps in different ways.

- Test your implementation by using the `Game`, `Chess`, and `Soccer` classes in a simple application to demonstrate the flexibility of defining an algorithm structure while allowing subclasses to offer a different implementation for some steps.
