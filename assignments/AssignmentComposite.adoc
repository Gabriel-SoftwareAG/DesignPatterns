== Composite Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Composite design pattern.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of composing objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

=== Instructions

- Imagine you are a landscape architect designing a park with various types of vegetation.
- Create a project named "ParkDesign" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Composite design pattern with the following components:

==== ParkElement
An interface or abstract class representing an element in the park, such as a tree or a flower bed. It should include methods for adding and removing child elements.

==== Tree, FlowerBed
Concrete classes representing specific types of park elements, such as trees and flower beds. They should implement the ParkElement interface and provide their own implementation of adding and removing child elements.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Composite pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- As the landscape architect, you are designing a park with various types of vegetation, including trees and flower beds.
- Implement a ParkElement interface with methods for adding and removing child elements.
- Create concrete classes such as Tree and FlowerBed that represent specific types of vegetation and implement the ParkElement interface.
- Use the Composite pattern to compose these elements into a tree structure, where a park can contain trees and flower beds, and each flower bed can contain additional flowers.

- Test your implementation by creating instances of different park elements and composing them into a tree structure.
- Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
