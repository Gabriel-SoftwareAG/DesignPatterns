= Assignment: Implementing the Flyweight Pattern in Java with Real-life Example

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Flyweight design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of minimizing memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with related objects.

== Instructions

1. Imagine you are the owner of a travel agency that offers vacation packages to various destinations.
2. Create a Java project named "VacationPackages" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
3. Implement the Flyweight design pattern with the following components:

=== Destination
An interface representing a destination for vacation packages, with methods for booking flights and accommodations.

=== DestinationFlyweightFactory
A factory class responsible for creating and managing flyweight objects representing destinations. It ensures that flyweight objects are shared and reused efficiently.

=== ConcreteDestination
A concrete class representing a specific destination for vacation packages. It implements the Destination interface and contains the unique data for each destination, such as flight details and hotel information.

=== Client
A client class representing a customer of the travel agency, with methods for booking vacation packages to different destinations.

4. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
5. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
6. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
7. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
8. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
9. Implement the Flyweight pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- As the owner of the travel agency, you want to optimize memory usage and computational expenses by sharing common destination data among multiple vacation packages.
- Implement a Destination interface with methods for booking flights and accommodations.
- Create a DestinationFlyweightFactory class responsible for creating and managing flyweight objects representing destinations.
- Implement ConcreteDestination classes representing specific destinations, with unique data such as flight details and hotel information.
- Use the Flyweight pattern to share common destination data among multiple vacation packages, minimizing memory usage and computational expenses.

10. Test your implementation by creating instances of Client and booking vacation packages to different destinations.
11. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
12. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
13. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing VacationPackages using the Flyweight pattern in Java with a real-life example!
