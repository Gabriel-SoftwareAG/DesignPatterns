== Flyweight Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Flyweight design pattern.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of minimizing memory usage or computational expenses by sharing as much as possible with related objects.

=== Instructions

- Imagine you are the owner of a travel agency that offers vacation packages to various destinations.
- Create a project named "VacationPackages" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Flyweight design pattern with the following components:

==== Destination
An interface representing a destination for vacation packages, with methods for booking flights and accommodations.

==== DestinationFlyweightFactory
A factory class responsible for creating and managing flyweight objects representing destinations. It ensures that flyweight objects are shared and reused efficiently.

==== ConcreteDestination
A concrete class representing a specific destination for vacation packages. It implements the Destination interface and contains the unique data for each destination, such as flight details and hotel information.

==== Client
A client class representing a customer of the travel agency, with methods for booking vacation packages to different destinations.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Flyweight pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- As the owner of the travel agency, you want to optimize memory usage and computational expenses by sharing common destination data among multiple vacation packages.
- Implement a Destination interface with methods for booking flights and accommodations.
- Create a DestinationFlyweightFactory class responsible for creating and managing flyweight objects representing destinations.
- Implement ConcreteDestination classes representing specific destinations, with unique data such as flight details and hotel information.
- Use the Flyweight pattern to share common destination data among multiple vacation packages, minimizing memory usage and computational expenses.

- Test your implementation by creating instances of Client and booking vacation packages to different destinations.
