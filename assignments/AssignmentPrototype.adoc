== Prototype Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Prototype design pattern.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of creating new objects by copying an existing object.

=== Instructions

- Imagine you are a toy manufacturer specializing in custom plush toys.
- Create a project named "PlushToyFactory" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Prototype design pattern with the following components:

==== Toy
An abstract class or interface representing a plush toy, with methods for cloning itself.

==== PlushToy
A concrete class representing a specific type of plush toy, such as a teddy bear or a bunny, that implements the Toy interface and provides its own clone method to create copies of itself.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Prototype pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- As a plush toy manufacturer, you have various designs for plush toys, including teddy bears, bunnies, and kittens.
- Create concrete classes such as TeddyBear, Bunny, and Kitten that implement the Toy interface and provide their own clone method to create copies of themselves.
- Use the Prototype pattern to clone instances of these plush toys and create new instances with different variations (e.g., different colors, sizes).

- Test your implementation by creating instances of different plush toys and cloning them to create new instances with different variations.
