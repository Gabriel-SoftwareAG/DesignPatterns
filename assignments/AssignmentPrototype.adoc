= Home Assignment: Implementing the Prototype Pattern in Java with Real-life Example

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Prototype design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of creating new objects by copying an existing object.

== Instructions

1. Imagine you are a toy manufacturer specializing in custom plush toys.
2. Create a Java project named "PlushToyFactory" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
3. Implement the Prototype design pattern with the following components:

=== Toy
An abstract class or interface representing a plush toy, with methods for cloning itself.

=== PlushToy
A concrete class representing a specific type of plush toy, such as a teddy bear or a bunny, that implements the Toy interface and provides its own clone method to create copies of itself.

4. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
5. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
6. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
7. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
8. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
9. Implement the Prototype pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- As a plush toy manufacturer, you have various designs for plush toys, including teddy bears, bunnies, and kittens.
- Create concrete classes such as TeddyBear, Bunny, and Kitten that implement the Toy interface and provide their own clone method to create copies of themselves.
- Use the Prototype pattern to clone instances of these plush toys and create new instances with different variations (e.g., different colors, sizes).

10. Test your implementation by creating instances of different plush toys and cloning them to create new instances with different variations.
11. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
12. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
13. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing a PlushToyFactory using the Prototype pattern in Java with a real-life example!
