== Adapter Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Adapter design pattern.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of allowing objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

=== Instructions

- Imagine you are the owner of a vintage vinyl record store, and you want to digitize your collection for online sales.
- Create a project named "VinylRecordStore" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Adapter design pattern with the following components:

==== RecordPlayer
An interface representing a vinyl record player, with methods for playing and stopping the record.

==== ModernMediaPlayer
An interface representing a modern digital media player, with methods for playing and pausing digital audio files.

==== RecordPlayerAdapter
A class that implements the ModernMediaPlayer interface and adapts the RecordPlayer interface to work with modern media players.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practice coding conventions.
- Add documentation comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Adapter pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- As the owner of the vintage vinyl record store, you have a collection of classic vinyl records that you want to digitize and sell online.
- Implement a RecordPlayer interface with methods for playing and stopping the vinyl record.
- Implement a ModernMediaPlayer interface with methods for playing and pausing digital audio files.
- Create a RecordPlayerAdapter class that adapts the RecordPlayer interface to work with the ModernMediaPlayer interface, allowing you to play vinyl records on modern media players.

- Test your implementation by creating instances of the RecordPlayerAdapter and using it to play vinyl records on modern media players.
