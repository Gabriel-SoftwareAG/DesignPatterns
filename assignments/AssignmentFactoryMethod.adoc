== Factory Method Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Factory Method design pattern.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of defining an interface for creating objects and letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

=== Instructions

- Imagine you are the owner of a chocolate factory specializing in artisanal chocolate bars.
- Create a project named "ChocolateBarFactory" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Factory Method design pattern with the following components:

==== ChocolateBar
An abstract class or interface representing a chocolate bar, with methods for producing and packaging the bar.

==== ChocolateBarFactory
An abstract class or interface defining a method for creating chocolate bars. This class acts as a factory for producing different types of chocolate bars.

==== DarkChocolateBarFactory, MilkChocolateBarFactory, WhiteChocolateBarFactory
Concrete subclasses of ChocolateBarFactory that implement the factory method to create specific types of chocolate bars (dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate).

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Factory Method pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- As the owner of the chocolate factory, you have recipes for various types of chocolate bars, including dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate bars.
- Implement concrete factories such as DarkChocolateBarFactory, MilkChocolateBarFactory, and WhiteChocolateBarFactory that produce specific types of chocolate bars based on their recipes.
- Use the Factory Method pattern to create instances of these chocolate bars and package them accordingly.

- Test your implementation by creating instances of different types of chocolate bars using the respective factories.
