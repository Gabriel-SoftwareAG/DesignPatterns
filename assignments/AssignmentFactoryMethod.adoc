= Home Assignment: Implementing the Factory Method Pattern in Java with Real-life Example

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Factory Method design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of defining an interface for creating objects and letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate.

== Instructions

1. Imagine you are the owner of a chocolate factory specializing in artisanal chocolate bars.
2. Create a Java project named "ChocolateBarFactory" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
3. Implement the Factory Method design pattern with the following components:

=== ChocolateBar
An abstract class or interface representing a chocolate bar, with methods for producing and packaging the bar.

=== ChocolateBarFactory
An abstract class or interface defining a method for creating chocolate bars. This class acts as a factory for producing different types of chocolate bars.

=== DarkChocolateBarFactory, MilkChocolateBarFactory, WhiteChocolateBarFactory
Concrete subclasses of ChocolateBarFactory that implement the factory method to create specific types of chocolate bars (dark chocolate, milk chocolate, white chocolate).

4. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
5. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
6. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
7. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
8. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
9. Implement the Factory Method pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- As the owner of the chocolate factory, you have recipes for various types of chocolate bars, including dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate bars.
- Implement concrete factories such as DarkChocolateBarFactory, MilkChocolateBarFactory, and WhiteChocolateBarFactory that produce specific types of chocolate bars based on their recipes.
- Use the Factory Method pattern to create instances of these chocolate bars and package them accordingly.

10. Test your implementation by creating instances of different types of chocolate bars using the respective factories.
11. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
12. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
13. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing a ChocolateBarFactory using the Factory Method pattern in Java with a real-life example!
