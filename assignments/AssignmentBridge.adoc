== Bridge Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Bridge design pattern.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of separating an objectâ€™s abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently.

=== Instructions

- Imagine you are a toy manufacturer creating a line of remote-controlled cars.
- Create a project named "RemoteControlCars" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Bridge design pattern with the following components:

==== Car
An interface representing a remote-controlled car, with methods for driving forward, backward, turning left, and turning right.

==== RemoteControl
An interface representing a remote control for the car, with methods for controlling the car's movements.

==== RemoteControlImpl
A concrete class implementing the RemoteControl interface, which contains a reference to the Car interface and delegates the control commands to the car.

==== CarModel
An interface representing different models of remote-controlled cars, with methods for specifying car features such as speed and color.

==== CarImpl
A concrete class implementing the Car interface, which represents a specific model of remote-controlled car. It contains the implementation details of how the car moves and turns.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practice coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Bridge pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- As a toy manufacturer, you want to create a line of remote-controlled cars with different models and control mechanisms.
- Implement a Car interface with methods for driving and turning the car.
- Create a RemoteControl interface representing a remote control for the car, with methods for controlling the car's movements.
- Implement a RemoteControlImpl class that contains a reference to the Car interface and delegates control commands to the car.
- Implement a CarModel interface representing different models of remote-controlled cars, with methods for specifying car features such as speed and color.
- Create a CarImpl class representing a specific model of remote-controlled car, with the implementation details of how the car moves and turns.

- Test your implementation by creating instances of RemoteControl and different Car models, and controlling the cars using the remote control.
