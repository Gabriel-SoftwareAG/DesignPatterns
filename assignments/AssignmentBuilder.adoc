= Builder Pattern for API Requests Exercise 

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Builder design pattern in Java for constructing API request objects.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of separating the construction of complex objects from their representation.

== Instructions

- Create a Java project named "ApiRequestBuilder" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Builder design pattern with the following components:

=== ApiRequest
The class that represents an API request object, containing fields such as:
  - URL: The endpoint URL of the API.
  - Method: The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) used for the request.
  - Headers: Any additional headers to be included in the request.
  - Parameters: Any query parameters to be sent with the request.
  - Body: The request body, if applicable.

=== ApiRequestBuilder
The builder class that constructs and assembles parts of the ApiRequest object.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
- Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
- Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
- Commit your initial project setup to Git.
- Implement the Builder pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- Implement an ApiRequestBuilder class to construct API request objects with different properties such as:
  - Setting the URL of the API endpoint.
  - Specifying the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) to be used.
  - Adding headers to the request.
  - Setting query parameters for the request.
  - Providing a request body, if applicable.

- Test your implementation by using the ApiRequestBuilder to construct various API request objects with different configurations.
- Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
- Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.
