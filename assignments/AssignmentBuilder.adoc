== Builder Design Pattern for API Requests Exercise 

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Builder design pattern for constructing API request objects.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of separating the construction of complex objects from their representation.

=== Instructions

- Create project named "ApiRequestBuilder" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Builder design pattern with the following components:

==== ApiRequest
The class that represents an API request object, containing fields such as:
  - URL: The endpoint URL of the API.
  - Method: The HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) used for the request.
  - Headers: Any additional headers to be included in the request.
  - Parameters: Any query parameters to be sent with the request.
  - Body: The request body, if applicable.

==== ApiRequestBuilder
The builder class that constructs and assembles parts of the ApiRequest object.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practice coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Builder pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- Implement an ApiRequestBuilder class to construct API request objects with different properties such as:
  - Setting the URL of the API endpoint.
  - Specifying the HTTP method (e.g., GET, POST) to be used.
  - Adding headers to the request.
  - Setting query parameters for the request.
  - Providing a request body, if applicable.

- Test your implementation by using the ApiRequestBuilder to construct various API request objects with different configurations.
