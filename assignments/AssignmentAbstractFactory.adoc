== Abstract Factory Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Abstract Factory design pattern.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of providing an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

=== Instructions

- Imagine you are the owner of a fashion design studio specializing in custom-made outfits.
- Create a project named "FashionDesignStudio" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Abstract Factory design pattern with the following components:

==== OutfitFactory
An abstract class or interface defining methods for creating different types of outfits, such as tops and bottoms.

==== CasualOutfitFactory, FormalOutfitFactory
Concrete subclasses of OutfitFactory that implement methods to create specific types of outfits suitable for casual and formal occasions, respectively.

==== Top, Bottom
Abstract classes or interfaces representing different components of an outfit, with methods for designing and customizing the outfit.

==== CasualTop, CasualBottom, FormalTop, FormalBottom
Concrete subclasses of Top and Bottom representing specific types of casual and formal tops and bottoms.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Implement the Abstract Factory pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- As the owner of the fashion design studio, you cater to clients with different preferences for outfits, including casual and formal wear.
- Implement concrete factories such as CasualOutfitFactory and FormalOutfitFactory that create specific types of outfits suitable for casual and formal occasions, respectively.
- Use the Abstract Factory pattern to create instances of these outfits, consisting of tops and bottoms, designed according to the client's specifications.

- Test your implementation by creating instances of different types of outfits using the respective factories.
