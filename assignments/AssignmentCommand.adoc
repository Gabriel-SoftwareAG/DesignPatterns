=  Assignment: Implementing the Command Design Pattern in Java

== Objective

* To understand and implement the Command design pattern in Java.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of decoupling command execution from the sender.

== Instructions

. Create a Java project named "CommandPatternExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
. Implement the Command design pattern with the following components:

=== Command Interface
An interface for declaring an execution method in all concrete command classes.

=== Concrete Command
Classes that implement the Command interface and define the binding between a Receiver object and an action.

=== Receiver
The class that performs the actual action when the command is executed.

=== Invoker
The class that asks the command to carry out the request.

=== Client
The class that creates a ConcreteCommand object and sets its receiver.

. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
. Implement the Command pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
Implement a RemoteControl class as the Invoker, which will use Command objects to perform various actions on a Television (e.g., turn on, turn off, change channel).

. Test your implementation by using the RemoteControl class in a simple application to control the Television.
. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.
