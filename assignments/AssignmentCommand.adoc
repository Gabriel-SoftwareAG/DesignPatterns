==  Command Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

* To understand and implement the Command design pattern.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of decoupling command execution from the sender.

=== Instructions

- Create a project named "CommandPatternExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Command design pattern with the following components:

==== Command Interface
An interface for declaring an execution method in all concrete command classes.

==== Concrete Command
Classes that implement the Command interface and define the binding between a Receiver object and an action.

==== Receiver
The class that performs the actual action when the command is executed.

==== Invoker
The class that asks the command to carry out the request.

==== Client
The class that creates a ConcreteCommand object and sets its receiver.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practice coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Command pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
Implement a RemoteControl class as the Invoker, which will use Command objects to perform various actions on a Television (e.g., turn on, turn off, change channel).

- Test your implementation by using the RemoteControl class in a simple application to control the Television.
