=  Assignment: Implementing the Memento Design Pattern in Java

== Objective

* To understand and implement the Memento design pattern in Java.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of how to capture and restore an object's state without violating encapsulation.

== Instructions

. Create a Java project named "MementoPatternExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
. Implement the Memento design pattern with the following components:

=== Memento
A class that will store the state of the Originator. It should have methods for saving and retrieving the state.

=== Originator
The class whose state needs to be saved and restored at a later time. It should create and use Mementos to save and restore its state.

=== Caretaker
The class that keeps track of multiple mementos. It does not modify the mementos but keeps them available for the Originator.

. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
. Implement the Memento pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
Implement a TextEditor class as the Originator, which can undo text changes using the Memento pattern. A History class will act as the Caretaker, managing mementos representing different states of the TextEditor's content.

. Test your implementation by using the TextEditor and History classes in a simple application to demonstrate undo functionality.
. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.
