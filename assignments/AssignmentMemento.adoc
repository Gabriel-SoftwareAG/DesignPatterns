==  Memento Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

* To understand and implement the Memento design pattern.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of how to capture and restore an object's state without violating encapsulation.

=== Instructions

- Create a project named "MementoPatternExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Memento design pattern with the following components:

==== Memento
A class that will store the state of the Originator. It should have methods for saving and retrieving the state.

==== Originator
The class whose state needs to be saved and restored at a later time. It should create and use Mementos to save and restore its state.

==== Caretaker
The class that keeps track of multiple mementos. It does not modify the mementos but keeps them available for the Originator.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Memento pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
Implement a TextEditor class as the Originator, which can undo text changes using the Memento pattern. A History class will act as the Caretaker, managing mementos representing different states of the TextEditor's content.

- Test your implementation by using the TextEditor and History classes in a simple application to demonstrate undo functionality.
