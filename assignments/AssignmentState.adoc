== State Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

* To understand and implement the State design pattern.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of managing state changes in an object without excessive use of conditional statements.

=== Instructions

- Create a project named "StatePatternExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the State design pattern with the following components:

==== State Interface
An interface that defines methods for performing actions associated with a particular state of the Context.

==== Concrete State Classes
Classes that implement the State interface and provide the specific behavior associated with a state of the Context.

==== Context
The class that maintains an instance of a Concrete State object and delegates state-specific behavior to it.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the State pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
Implement a VendingMachine class as the Context, which changes its state based on operations like inserting coins, selecting products, or dispensing items.

- Test your implementation by using the VendingMachine class in a simple application to demonstrate how it changes its behavior based on its state.
