= Assignment: Implementing the State Design Pattern in Java

== Objective

* To understand and implement the State design pattern in Java.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of managing state changes in an object without excessive use of conditional statements.

== Instructions

. Create a Java project named "StatePatternExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
. Implement the State design pattern with the following components:

=== State Interface
An interface that defines methods for performing actions associated with a particular state of the Context.

=== Concrete State Classes
Classes that implement the State interface and provide the specific behavior associated with a state of the Context.

=== Context
The class that maintains an instance of a Concrete State object and delegates state-specific behavior to it.

. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
. Implement the State pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
Implement a VendingMachine class as the Context, which changes its state based on operations like inserting coins, selecting products, or dispensing items.

. Test your implementation by using the VendingMachine class in a simple application to demonstrate how it changes its behavior based on its state.
. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.
