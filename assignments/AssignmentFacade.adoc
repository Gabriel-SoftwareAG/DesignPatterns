== Facade Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Facade design pattern.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of providing a simplified interface to a larger body of code.

=== Instructions

- Imagine you are a travel booking platform that provides various services for travelers.
- Create a project named "TravelBooking" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Facade design pattern with the following components:

==== TravelBookingFacade
A facade class that provides a simplified interface for booking travel services, such as flights, hotels, and rental cars.

==== FlightBookingSystem, HotelBookingSystem, RentalCarBookingSystem
Subsystem classes that handle specific aspects of booking travel services, such as flights, hotels, and rental cars.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Facade pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- As a travel booking platform, you want to provide travelers with a simple interface for booking flights, hotels, and rental cars.
- Implement a TravelBookingFacade class that acts as a facade for the travel booking system, providing methods for booking flights, hotels, and rental cars.
- Create FlightBookingSystem, HotelBookingSystem, and RentalCarBookingSystem classes representing subsystems that handle specific aspects of booking travel services.
- Use the Facade pattern to hide the complexities of interacting with the subsystems and provide a simplified interface for travelers to book their travel services.

- Test your implementation by creating instances of TravelBookingFacade and booking flights, hotels, and rental cars using the facade methods.
