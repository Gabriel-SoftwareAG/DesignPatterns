= Singleton Pattern Exercise

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Singleton design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of ensuring only one instance of a class is created.

== Instructions

- Create a Java project named "SingletonExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Singleton design pattern with the following components:

== Singleton
The class that ensures only one instance is created and provides a global point of access to it.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
- Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
- Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
- Commit your initial project setup to Git.
- Implement the Singleton pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

== Scenario
- Implement a Logger class as a Singleton to maintain a single log instance throughout the system.

- Test your implementation by using the Logger class in a simple application to log messages.
- Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
- Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.
