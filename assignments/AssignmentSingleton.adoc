= Home Assignment: Implementing the Singleton Pattern in Java

== Objective

- To understand and implement the Singleton design pattern in Java.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of ensuring only one instance of a class is created.

== Instructions

1. Create a Java project named "SingletonExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
2. Implement the Singleton design pattern with the following components:

=== Singleton
The class that ensures only one instance is created and provides a global point of access to it.

3. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
4. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
5. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
6. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
7. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
8. Implement the Singleton pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
- Implement a Logger class as a Singleton to maintain a single log instance throughout the system.

9. Test your implementation by using the Logger class in a simple application to log messages.
10. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
11. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
12. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.

== Submission

- Share the link to your Git repository with your instructor for evaluation.
- Ensure that your repository is publicly accessible and well-documented to facilitate review.

== Note

- Feel free to consult online resources, textbooks, or other references while working on the assignment.
- Remember to adhere to academic integrity guidelines and avoid plagiarism.
- Enjoy the process of designing and implementing a Logger class using the Singleton pattern in Java!
