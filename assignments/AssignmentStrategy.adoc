== Strategy Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Strategy design pattern.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable.

=== Instructions

- Imagine you are a delivery service provider that offers different shipping options to customers.
- Create a project named "ShippingService" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Strategy design pattern with the following components:

==== ShippingStrategy
An interface representing a shipping strategy, with a method for calculating the shipping cost.

==== StandardShipping, ExpressShipping, SameDayShipping
Concrete classes implementing the ShippingStrategy interface, representing different shipping options with their own algorithms for calculating shipping costs.

==== ShippingContext
A context class that contains a reference to a ShippingStrategy and allows clients to change the shipping strategy dynamically.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Strategy pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- As a delivery service provider, you want to offer customers different shipping options with varying costs.
- Implement a ShippingStrategy interface with a method for calculating the shipping cost.
- Create StandardShipping, ExpressShipping, and SameDayShipping classes representing different shipping options with their own algorithms for calculating shipping costs.
- Implement a ShippingContext class that contains a reference to a ShippingStrategy and allows clients to change the shipping strategy dynamically.
- Use the Strategy pattern to encapsulate each shipping algorithm and make them interchangeable, allowing customers to choose different shipping options at checkout.

- Test your implementation by creating instances of ShippingContext with different shipping strategies and calculating shipping costs for various orders.
