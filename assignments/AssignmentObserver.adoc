== Observer Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Observer design pattern.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of the relationship between subjects and observers.

=== Instructions

- Create a project named "WeatherStation" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Observer design pattern with the following components:

==== WeatherStation
The subject that provides temperature updates to various displays.

==== WeatherDisplay
The observer interface that defines the update method, which is called by the subject to notify displays of temperature changes.

==== CurrentConditionsDisplay, StatisticsDisplay, and ForecastDisplay
Concrete implementations of the WeatherDisplay interface that receive temperature updates from the WeatherStation and display them in different ways.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Observer pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- Imagine a weather station that provides temperature updates to various displays.
- The weather station is the subject, and the displays are observers.
- Each display (observer) should receive temperature updates from the weather station (subject) and display them.

- Test your implementation by creating a simple application that simulates temperature updates and displays them on different types of displays.
