=  Assignment: Implementing the Visitor Design Pattern in Java

== Objective

* To understand and implement the Visitor design pattern in Java.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of how to separate an algorithm from the object structure on which it operates.

== Instructions

. Create a Java project named "VisitorPatternExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
. Implement the Visitor design pattern with the following components:

=== Visitor Interface
An interface that defines a set of visiting methods, which declare operations to be performed on elements of an object structure.

=== Concrete Visitor
Classes that implement the Visitor interface and define the operations to perform on the elements of the object structure.

=== Element Interface
An interface defining the `accept(visitor)` method that takes a visitor and allows it to perform some operation on the element.

=== Concrete Element
Classes that implement the Element interface and define the actual elements that the visitor visits.

=== Object Structure
A class or collection that aggregates elements and can enumerate its elements to allow the visitor to visit each element.

. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
. Implement the Visitor pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
Implement a `Document` object structure where elements like `TextSection`, `ImageSection`, and `TableSection` can be visited. Create a `DocumentStatisticsVisitor` that gathers and reports statistics such as the number of words in text sections, the number of images, and the number of tables.

. Test your implementation by using the `Document` and `DocumentStatisticsVisitor` in a simple application to analyze and report statistics of various sections.
. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.
