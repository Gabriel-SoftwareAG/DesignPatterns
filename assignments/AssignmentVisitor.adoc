==  Visitor Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

* To understand and implement the Visitor design pattern.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of how to separate an algorithm from the object structure on which it operates.

=== Instructions

- Create a project named "VisitorPatternExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Visitor design pattern with the following components:

==== Visitor Interface
An interface that defines a set of visiting methods, which declare operations to be performed on elements of an object structure.

==== Concrete Visitor
Classes that implement the Visitor interface and define the operations to perform on the elements of the object structure.

==== Element Interface
An interface defining the `accept(visitor)` method that takes a visitor and allows it to perform some operation on the element.

==== Concrete Element
Classes that implement the Element interface and define the actual elements that the visitor visits.

==== Object Structure
A class or collection that aggregates elements and can enumerate its elements to allow the visitor to visit each element.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Visitor pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
Implement a `Document` object structure where elements like `TextSection`, `ImageSection`, and `TableSection` can be visited. Create a `DocumentStatisticsVisitor` that gathers and reports statistics such as the number of words in text sections, the number of images, and the number of tables.

- Test your implementation by using the `Document` and `DocumentStatisticsVisitor` in a simple application to analyze and report statistics of various sections.
