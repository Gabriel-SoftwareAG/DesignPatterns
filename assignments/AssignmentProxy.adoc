== Proxy Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Proxy design pattern.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of providing a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

=== Instructions

- Imagine you are the owner of a high-end art gallery that displays valuable artworks.
- Create a project named "ArtGallery" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Proxy design pattern with the following components:

==== Artwork
An interface representing an artwork, with methods for viewing and purchasing the artwork.

==== RealArtwork
A concrete class representing a real artwork in the gallery. It implements the Artwork interface and contains the actual implementation of viewing and purchasing the artwork.

==== ArtworkProxy
A proxy class that acts as a placeholder for the real artwork. It implements the Artwork interface and controls access to the real artwork by adding extra functionality such as access control or logging.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Proxy pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- As the owner of the art gallery, you want to protect your valuable artworks from unauthorized access and track viewing and purchasing activities.
- Implement an Artwork interface with methods for viewing and purchasing the artwork.
- Create a RealArtwork class representing a real artwork in the gallery, with actual implementations of viewing and purchasing methods.
- Implement an ArtworkProxy class that acts as a proxy for the real artwork, controlling access to it by adding extra functionality such as access control and logging.

- Test your implementation by creating instances of ArtworkProxy and accessing real artworks through the proxy.
