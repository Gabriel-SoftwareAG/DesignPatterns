=  Assignment: Implementing the Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern in Java

== Objective

* To understand and implement the Chain of Responsibility design pattern in Java.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of how to pass a request along a chain of handlers without knowing which handler will process the request.

== Instructions

. Create a Java project named "ChainOfResponsibilityExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
. Implement the Chain of Responsibility design pattern with the following components:

=== Handler Interface
An interface with a method that defines how requests are handled and includes setting the next handler in the chain.

=== Concrete Handlers
Classes that implement the Handler interface. Each handler decides whether to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

=== Client
The class that initiates the request to the chain of handlers.

. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
. Implement the Chain of Responsibility pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
Implement a `DocumentHandler` chain where different handlers are responsible for opening different types of documents (e.g., `PDFHandler`, `DocHandler`, `TextHandler`). Each handler will attempt to open a document and pass it to the next handler in the chain if it is not the correct handler for the file type.

. Test your implementation by using the `DocumentHandler` chain in a simple application to open various types of documents.
. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.
