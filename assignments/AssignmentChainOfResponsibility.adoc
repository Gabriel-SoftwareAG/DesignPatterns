==  Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

* To understand and implement the Chain of Responsibility design pattern.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of how to pass a request along a chain of handlers without knowing which handler will process the request.

=== Instructions

- Create a project named "ChainOfResponsibilityExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Chain of Responsibility design pattern with the following components:

==== Handler Interface
An interface with a method that defines how requests are handled and includes setting the next handler in the chain.

==== Concrete Handlers
Classes that implement the Handler interface. Each handler decides whether to process the request or to pass it to the next handler in the chain.

==== Client
The class that initiates the request to the chain of handlers.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Chain of Responsibility pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
Implement a `DocumentHandler` chain where different handlers are responsible for opening different types of documents (e.g., `PDFHandler`, `DocHandler`, `TextHandler`). Each handler will attempt to open a document and pass it to the next handler in the chain if it is not the correct handler for the file type.

- Test your implementation by using the `DocumentHandler` chain in a simple application to open various types of documents.
