==  Mediator Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

* To understand and implement the Mediator design pattern.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of how to centralize complex communications and control between related objects.

=== Instructions

- Create a project named "MediatorPatternExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Mediator design pattern with the following components:

==== Mediator Interface
An interface that defines the method for communicating with objects.

==== Concrete Mediator
A class that implements the Mediator interface and coordinates communication between Colleague objects. It knows and maintains its colleagues.

==== Colleague Classes
Classes that communicate with each other through the Mediator interface. These should not communicate directly with each other but instead through the mediator.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Mediator pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
Implement a `ChatRoom` as the Concrete Mediator that facilitates communication between multiple `User` objects (Colleagues). Each `User` can send and receive messages to the chat room, which then forwards these messages to all other users.

- Test your implementation by using the `ChatRoom` and `User` classes in a simple application to demonstrate the communication facilitated by the Mediator.
