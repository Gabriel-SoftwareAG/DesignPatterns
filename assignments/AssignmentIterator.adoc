==  Iterator Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

* To understand and implement the Iterator design pattern.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of how to provide a way to access the elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.

=== Instructions

- Create a project named "IteratorPatternExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Iterator design pattern with the following components:

==== Aggregate Interface
An interface that creates an Iterator object.

==== Concrete Aggregate
A class that implements the Aggregate interface and contains a collection or list of items over which to iterate.

==== Iterator Interface
An interface that defines the methods necessary for iteration, such as `hasNext()`, `next()`, and possibly `remove()`.

==== Concrete Iterator
A class that implements the Iterator interface and is responsible for managing the current position of the iterator and the iteration logic over the collection.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Iterator pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
Implement a `BookCollection` class as the Concrete Aggregate that contains a collection of `Book` objects. Develop a `BookIterator` as the Concrete Iterator to allow traversal through the `BookCollection` without exposing the underlying structure (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList).

- Test your implementation by using the `BookCollection` and `BookIterator` in a simple application to iterate over a collection of books and print details of each book.
