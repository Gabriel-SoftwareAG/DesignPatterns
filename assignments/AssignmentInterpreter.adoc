==  Interpreter Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

* To understand and implement the Interpreter design pattern.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of how to define a grammatical representation for a language and an interpreter that uses this representation to interpret sentences in the language.

=== Instructions

- Create a project named "InterpreterPatternExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Interpreter design pattern with the following components:

==== Abstract Expression
An interface or abstract class defining the method `interpret(context)` that all specific expressions will implement.

==== Terminal Expression
A class that implements the Abstract Expression and interprets the terminal symbols of the grammar.

==== Nonterminal Expression
Classes that implement the Abstract Expression to interpret non-terminal symbols. They typically store instances of the Expression class.

===== Context
A class containing information that's global to the interpreter.

==== Client
The class that builds or is given a parse tree of Abstract Expression instances configured to interpret a particular context.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Interpreter pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
Implement a `RomanNumeralsInterpreter` to convert Roman numeral strings into their decimal representations. The interpreter should handle basic Roman numerals (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) and combinations thereof.

- Test your implementation by using the `RomanNumeralsInterpreter` in a simple application to convert Roman numerals to numbers.
