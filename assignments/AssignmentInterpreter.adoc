=  Assignment: Implementing the Interpreter Design Pattern in Java

== Objective

* To understand and implement the Interpreter design pattern in Java.
* To enhance skills in object-oriented programming and design patterns.
* To develop a clear understanding of how to define a grammatical representation for a language and an interpreter that uses this representation to interpret sentences in the language.

== Instructions

. Create a Java project named "InterpreterPatternExample" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
. Implement the Interpreter design pattern with the following components:

=== Abstract Expression
An interface or abstract class defining the method `interpret(context)` that all specific expressions will implement.

=== Terminal Expression
A class that implements the Abstract Expression and interprets the terminal symbols of the grammar.

=== Nonterminal Expression
Classes that implement the Abstract Expression to interpret non-terminal symbols. They typically store instances of the Expression class.

=== Context
A class containing information that's global to the interpreter.

=== Client
The class that builds or is given a parse tree of Abstract Expression instances configured to interpret a particular context.

. Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following Java coding conventions.
. Implement unit tests to ensure the correctness of your implementation.
. Add Javadoc comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
. Create a Git repository for your project and initialize it with a README.md file.
. Commit your initial project setup to Git.
. Implement the Interpreter pattern in Java according to the following scenario:

=== Scenario
Implement a `RomanNumeralsInterpreter` to convert Roman numeral strings into their decimal representations. The interpreter should handle basic Roman numerals (I, V, X, L, C, D, M) and combinations thereof.

. Test your implementation by using the `RomanNumeralsInterpreter` in a simple application to convert Roman numerals to numbers.
. Commit your changes to Git regularly, and push them to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
. Ensure your project structure is clean and organized, with separate directories for source code, documentation, tests, and any additional resources.
. Once you have completed the implementation, write a short reflection (README.md) on your experience, discussing any challenges you faced, how you addressed them, and what you learned from the assignment.
