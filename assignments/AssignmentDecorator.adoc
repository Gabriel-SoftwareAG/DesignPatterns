== Decorator Design Pattern Exercise

=== Objectives

- To understand and implement the Decorator design pattern.
- To practice object-oriented design principles and design patterns.
- To develop a clear understanding of attaching additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

=== Instructions

- Imagine you are a bakery owner who specializes in making custom cakes for special occasions.
- Create a project named "CustomCakes" using your preferred IDE or command-line tools.
- Implement the Decorator design pattern with the following components:

==== Cake
An interface representing a basic cake, with methods for describing and pricing the cake.

==== BasicCake
A concrete class implementing the Cake interface, representing a simple, basic cake.

==== CakeDecorator
An abstract decorator class that extends the Cake interface and acts as a base class for concrete decorators. It contains a reference to a Cake object.

==== FlavorDecorator, ToppingDecorator
Concrete decorator classes representing different cake decorations such as flavors and toppings. They extend the CakeDecorator class and add additional functionality to the cake.

- Write clean, modular, and well-documented code following best practices coding conventions.
- Add comments to all classes, interfaces, methods, and fields explaining their purpose and usage.
- Implement the Decorator pattern according to the following scenario:

==== Scenario
- As a bakery owner, you want to offer custom cakes with various flavors and toppings to your customers.
- Implement a Cake interface with methods for describing and pricing the cake.
- Create a BasicCake class representing a simple, basic cake.
- Implement a CakeDecorator abstract class that extends the Cake interface and contains a reference to a Cake object.
- Create FlavorDecorator and ToppingDecorator classes representing different cake decorations such as flavors and toppings. They extend the CakeDecorator class and add additional functionality to the cake.
- Use the Decorator pattern to dynamically add flavors and toppings to custom cakes while preserving the ability to mix and match decorations.

- Test your implementation by creating instances of BasicCake and decorating them with different flavors and toppings using decorator objects.
